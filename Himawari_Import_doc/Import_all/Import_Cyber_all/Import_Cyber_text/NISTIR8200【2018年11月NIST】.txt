Abstract
The Interagency International Cybersecurity Standardization Working Group (IICS WG) was
established in December 2015 by the National Security Council’s Cyber Interagency Policy
Committee. Its purpose is to coordinate on major issues in international cybersecurity
standardization and thereby enhance U.S. federal agency participation in the process.
Effective U.S. Government participation involves coordinating across the federal government and
working with the U.S. private sector. The U.S. relies more heavily on the private sector for
standards development than do many other countries. Companies and industry groups, academic
institutions, professional societies, consumer groups, and other interested parties are major
contributors to this process. Further, the many Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) which
provide the infrastructure for the standards development are overwhelmingly private sector
organizations.
On April 25, 2017, the IICS WG established an Internet of Things (IoT) Task Group to determine
the current state of international cybersecurity standards development for IoT. This report is
intended for use by the working group member agencies to assist them in their standards planning
and to help coordinate U.S. Government participation in international cybersecurity
standardization for IoT. Other organizations may also find this document useful in their planning.

Executive Summary
The Interagency International Cyber Security Working Group (IICS WG) was created in
response to recommendations contained in the 2015 Interagency Report on Strategic U.S.
Government Engagement in International Standardization to Achieve U.S. Objectives for
Cybersecurity (NIST Interagency Report 8074 Volume 1 [1]). This working group coordinates
on major issues in international cybersecurity standardization. It established an Internet of
Things (IoT) Task Group to develop this report on the status of international cybersecurity
standards relevant to IoT.
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

The growth of network-connected devices, systems, and services comprising the IoT creates
immense opportunities and benefits for our society [2]. However, to reap the great benefits of
IoT and to minimize the potentially significant risks, these network-connected devices need to be
secure and resilient. This depends in large part upon the timely availability and widespread
adoption of clear and effective international cybersecurity standards.
Both the government and the broader public are intended audiences for this report, which aims to
inform and enable policymakers, managers, and standards participants as they seek timely
development and use of such standards in IoT components, systems, and related services.
This report relies upon terms and definitions defined in Annex A – Terms and Definitions of
NISTIR 8074 Volume 2 [3]. It aims to establish a common understanding of IoT components,
systems and applications for which standards could be relevant. The report starts with a
functional description of IoT components, which are the basic building blocks of IoT systems.
To provide insights into the present state of IoT cybersecurity standardization, the report
describes five IoT technology application areas. These areas are certainly not exhaustive, but
they are sufficiently representative to use in analyzing the present state of IoT cybersecurity
standardization:






Connected vehicle IoT enables vehicles, roads, and other infrastructure to communicate
and share vital transportation information.
Consumer IoT consists of IoT applications in residences as well as wearable and mobile
devices.
Health IoT processes data derived from sources such as electronic health records and
patient-generated health data.
Smart building IoT includes energy usage monitoring systems, physical access control
security systems and lighting control systems.
Smart manufacturing IoT enables enterprise-wide integration of data, technology,
advanced manufacturing capabilities, and cloud and other services.

IoT cybersecurity objectives, risks, and threats are then analyzed for IoT applications in general
and for each of the five illustrative IoT technology application areas. Cybersecurity objectives
for traditional information technology (IT) systems generally prioritize Confidentiality, then
Integrity, and lastly Availability. IoT systems cross multiple sectors as well as use cases within
those sectors. Accordingly, cybersecurity objectives may be prioritized very differently by
various parties, depending on the application. The increased ubiquity of IoT components and
systems heighten the risks they present. Standards-based cybersecurity risk management will
continue to be a major factor in the trustworthiness of IoT applications. Analysis of the
v

application areas makes it clear that cybersecurity for IoT is unique and requires tailoring
existing standards and creating new standards to address challenges, for example: pop-up
network connections, shared system components, the ability to change physical aspects of the
environment, and related connections to safety.

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

Building upon NISTIR 8074 Volume 2, this report describes 12 cybersecurity core areas and
provides examples of relevant standards. The analysis is based on the information in Annex D,
which maps cybersecurity standards that may be relevant for IoT systems to the dozen
cybersecurity core areas. The annotated standards listings in Annex D are not exhaustive, but
they represent an extensive effort to identify presently relevant IoT cybersecurity standards. The
market impacts of existing standards are noted; possible gaps in standards are identified in
Section 8. While the Annex D listing is a onetime snapshot, it should prove useful as a point of
departure for maintaining awareness of the evolving standards landscape. A summary of the
status of cybersecurity standardization for the five specific examples of IoT applications is
provided in Table 4.
The report’s conclusions focus upon the issue of standards gaps and the effective use of existing
standards. For example, further standards work is needed to secure communications which
leverage the Internet as the main gateway for IT to Operations Technology (OT).
For identified priorities, agencies should work with industry to initiate new standards projects in
Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) to close such gaps. In accordance with U.S.
Government policy [4], agencies should:
•
•
•

participate in the development of IoT cybersecurity standards,
cite appropriate standards in their procurements based upon their mission, and
work with industry to support the development of appropriate conformity assessment
schemes to help assure that the requirements in such standards are met.

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

Introduction

The Internet of Things (IoT) has already changed the world for individuals, as consumers and
citizens, as well as for governments and industry. The IoT is expected to provide more
revolutionary capability and become more ubiquitous. Yet, the adoption of IoT brings
cybersecurity risks that pose a significant threat to the Nation, to organizations, and to
individuals 1.

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

Securing IoT devices is a major challenge, as manufactures tend to focus on functionality,
compatibility requirements, customer convenience, and time-to-market rather than security.
Meanwhile, security threats are increasing. For example, Symantec reported a 600 % increase in
attacks against IoT devices from 2016 to 2017 [5].
The President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) has
examined the cybersecurity implications of IoT within the context of national security and
emergency preparedness. This examination “found that IoT adoption will increase in both speed
and scope, and that it will impact virtually all sectors of our society. Additionally, the NSTAC
determined that there is a small—and rapidly closing—window to ensure that IoT is adopted in a
way that maximizes security and minimizes risk. If the country fails to do so, it will be coping
with the consequences for generations [6].”
The President’s Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity reached a similar conclusion:
“The IoT facilitates linking an incredible range of devices and products to each other and the
world. Although this connectivity has the potential to revolutionize most industries and many
facets of everyday life, the possible harm that malicious actors could cause by exploiting these
technologies to gain access to parts of our critical infrastructure, given the current state of
cybersecurity, is immense [7].”
Our economy is increasingly global, complex, and interconnected. It is characterized by rapid
advances in information technology (IT). IT products and services need to provide sufficient
levels of cybersecurity and resilience. The timely availability of international cybersecurity
standards is a dynamic and critical component for the cybersecurity and resilience of all
information and communications systems and supporting infrastructures [1].
The growth of network-connected devices, systems, and services comprising the IoT creates
immense opportunities and benefits for our society [2]. However, to reap the great benefits of
IoT and to minimize the potentially significant risks, these network-connected devices need to be
secure and resilient. This depends in large part upon the timely availability and widespread
adoption of clear and effective international cybersecurity standards.

1 Cybersecurity is defined as “the prevention of damage to, unauthorized use of, exploitation of, and – if needed – the restoration
of electronic information and communications systems, and the information they contain, in order to strengthen the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of these systems” per NISTIR 8074 vol. 2

Scope

Consistent with U.S. Government policy, agencies are encouraged to support the development
and use of voluntary consensus standards, which are developed by predominantly private sector
led voluntary consensus standards bodies [4]. This report examines the current state of
international cybersecurity standards development by voluntary consensus standards bodies for
IoT. It distills IoT down to the simplest concepts and describes the nuances associated with these
concepts. It acknowledges but does not focus on specific technologies or concerns associated
with IoT such as societal impact, safety, or privacy.
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

This report recognizes that cybersecurity—and cybersecurity standards— can support
individuals’ safety and privacy. For example, cybersecurity standards when applied to the
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of personally identifiable information (PII) are an
important component of protecting individuals’ privacy. However, privacy cannot be achieved
solely by securing individuals’ PII (see Figure 1). As noted in NISTIR 8062, An Introduction to
Privacy Engineering and Risk Management in Federal Systems, privacy concerns can arise from
intentional or authorized processing of information about individuals, and in certain contexts,
even measures used to secure PII can result in privacy issues [8].

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

The Internet of Things (IoT)

IoT is a concept based on creating systems that interact with the physical world using networked
entities (e.g., sensors, actuators, information resources, people).
There can be confusion around the meaning of the term IoT for a variety of reasons. They
include: the cross-cutting aspect of IoT (specifically with respect to application domains); the
multitude of stakeholders involved in IoT and their specific use cases; the complexity of IoT; and
the rapidly changing technology supporting IoT.
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

While there is no universal definition of IoT, common elements exist among the many high-level
definitions and descriptions for IoT. A few IoT definitions and descriptions from other sources
are listed in Annex A. This report relies on the foundational concepts for IoT described in 4.1
below.
4.1

Foundational Concepts

The IoT consists of two foundational concepts:



IoT components are connected by a network providing the potential for a many-to-many
relationship between components (the network capability may or may not be
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) based); and
Some IoT components have sensors and actuators that allow the components to observe
(collect data about) and affect the physical world.

For the purposes of this report, the following definitions apply:
IoT component: The basic building block of an IoT system. Multiple IoT components interact
with each other to form a system and achieve one or more goals. Each IoT component provides
some function that is necessary within the system. An IoT component:
 must have at least one network interface that provides the ability to participate in a manyto-many network, although a given IoT component need not communicate with more
than one other IoT component in a given system (e.g., assigning and limiting
communication between two static IP addresses); and
 has some combination of the following capabilities: actuating; application interface; data
processing; data storing; data transferring; human user interface (UI); latent; sensing; and
supporting.
Other publications sometimes use “IoT device” as a synonym for “IoT component” or define
“device” as an actuator or sensor. Moreover, traditional IT resources (such as servers) also can
be considered IoT components.
System: a combination of interacting elements organized to achieve one or more stated purposes.
IoT system: a system composed of networked IoT components or other, integrated IoT systems
that interacts with a physical entity through sensors and/or actuators within the IoT components.
IoT systems differ from conventional IT systems in their ability to directly interact with the

STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

physical world. IoT systems may also be considered IoT components if the system provides a
network interface.
IoT environment: a set of IoT components and supporting technologies that are networked
together and can be built into IoT systems. Such IoT systems are also part of the IoT
environment. The Internet is an example of an IoT environment.
As shown in Figure 2 below, the IoT component is the basic element of an IoT system, and
provides some combination of the system’s capabilities.
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200
Figure 2 – Capabilities of an IoT Component.

An IoT system builder combines IoT components to create an IoT system that can meet a set of
requirements. By understanding each IoT component as a set of capabilities that are provided to
the rest of the system, an IoT system builder can match those capabilities to the IoT system
requirements. Using the capabilities model, an IoT component can be understood by the set of
capabilities it can provide to a system. These capabilities are illustrated in Figure 2 above and
described below.

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

Capabilities of an IoT Component

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

There are several types of IoT capabilities:
 Transducer capabilities interact with the physical world.
 Data capabilities are directly involved in providing functionality to the system.
 Interface capabilities provide the component the ability to interact with other IoT
components (including people).
 Supporting capabilities are indirectly involved in providing functionality to the system,
such as monitoring, management, security, or orchestration (the arrangement and
coordination of IoT components in an IoT system).
 Latent capabilities are transducer, data, interface, or supporting capabilities that are not
currently enabled and accessible outside the IoT component.
Actuating
An actuating capability provides the ability to make a change in the physical world based on
information given as input to the component. Examples include: heating coil (temperature
control), electric shock delivery (cardiac pacing), electronic door lock (lock/unlock), unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) operation (remote control), servo motors (simple motion/movement), and
robotic arm (complex motion/movement).
Application Interface
An application interface capability provides the ability for other computing devices
(components, systems, etc.) to communicate with the IoT component through an IoT component
application. An example of an application interface is an application programming interface
(API).
Data Processing
A data processing capability provides the ability to transform data based on an algorithm. The
transformation may be very simple, with a single input variable and a single output, or it may be
complex with multiple inputs and outputs. Control algorithms are an important type of
processing that take the output of sensor(s) and actuator(s) or pre-processor(s) and provide an
output that can be fed into an actuator or post-processor. These control algorithms often are used
within negative feedback loops, but not always. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) 3
controller (widely used in industrial control systems) is an example of such a control algorithm.
Another example is an algorithm which models the human insulin response in a real-time system
that manages the function of an artificial pancreas. Additional examples of data processing
include: data aggregation capability, predictive analysis, and binary (Yes/No) analysis.
Data Storing
A data storing capability provides the ability to store and retrieve data for later use. Examples
include storage of component input as well as the storage of component generated data, such as
electronic patient records.
Data Transferring

NISTIR 8200

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

A data transferring capability provides the ability to move data from one physical or logical
location to another. The data transferring capability provides the ability to ‘black box’ a network
and provide information about the network without having to understand the specific network
topology. A component’s data transferring capability impacts the latency of information flow as
well as the rate at which that information can flow. Some examples of data transferring
capability include data networks based on: Ethernet protocol, and Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 wireless protocol.
Human User Interface (UI)

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

A human UI capability provides the ability for the component to interact directly with people.
Not all IoT components will have a human UI. These components will pass information to other
system components in order to support the UI capability. Examples include: optical and tactile
displays and audio input and output.
Latent
Latent capabilities are not currently enabled for access externally to the IoT component. For
example, a component may have a USB port, but nothing is plugged into that port. In that state,
the USB port is considered a latent capability. It has the potential to be used at any time, and if
someone attaches something to it, that could enable any of the other capabilities; if someone
plugs a Wi-FiTM adapter into the USB port, the IoT component would then have an additional
network interface capability.
Network Interface
A network interface capability provides the interface between digital communication network
components necessary for communicating data. Every IoT component must have at least one
network interface capability. While the network interface capability allows for a component to be
connected to a communication network, it does not provide the data transferring capability itself.
Capability examples include: Ethernet adapter interface, cellular interface, and ZigBee radio
interface.
Sensing

An IoT Component as a Black Box
From an IoT perspective, a “black box” viewpoint of each component is useful, because an IoT
system builder may not have access to any details of the internal workings of a particular IoT
component. In fact, the internal workings of a component may change over time. This is
especially relevant for IoT systems of systems, in which components are comprised of a set of
other IoT components. When interfaces, capabilities, and limitations of a component are
accurately and completely documented, including any details necessary for the system builder to
map the component against capabilities to system requirements, the details of the inner workings
may not be important. An IoT component that is documented in this manner provides the
described capabilities within the described limitations, and can be easily integrated into systems,
regardless of internal implementations. There are use cases where the internal workings of an
IoT component may need to be completely documented and understood, including National
Security Systems (NSS) and systems that carry a risk of injury or harm to an individual.

Some IoT systems have direct connections to owner networks, while others directly
connect to non-owner networks. Some IoT systems have direct connections to both
owner and non-owner networks.
IoT systems may comprise highly distributed IoT components that have a variety of
owners or no defined owner.
Some IoT systems are intended for use by or association with a particular person or group
of people, while others are autonomous.
Some IoT components use low-capability computing hardware (minimal processing,
storage, etc.) and have low power consumption.
Some IoT components are largely static (e.g., software cannot be updated, configuration
cannot be changed as needed).
Some IoT components process data locally, some IoT components have their data
processed remotely, and some do both.
A single IoT sensor may collect massive volumes of data.
IoT components are highly heterogeneous (operating systems, network
interfaces/protocols, functions, etc.)
Many IoT systems rely on proprietary protocols for data communication.
IoT systems are often deployed as part of highly dynamic systems and system
environments.
Many IoT systems do not provide centralized management capabilities for the owner.
Many IoT systems can be remotely controlled by first parties (e.g., manufacturers).
Some IoT components are deployed in physically unrestricted locations, making it
difficult to provide physical security.
IoT components may encounter statistical errors when sensing and acting on physical
objects.
IoT systems may affect the safety, reliability, resiliency, performance, and other aspects
of an owner’s computing infrastructure and physical presence. If a failure occurs, the IoT

compromised IoT component online, take a component offline.)
IoT systems may collect, store, and use data that the owner’s personnel are not aware of
or cannot manage properly.
Some IoT systems have the ability to manage, update, and patch IoT components at scale.
Some IoT systems support impromptu architectural changes.
Some IoT systems are created through novel combinations of existing IoT systems and
data streams that are re-purposed for an application not envisioned by the original
designers. Further, such IoT systems may evolve as additional sensors or data streams
become available or accessible.
Some IoT systems include IoT components designed for decades-long use, such as smart
meters in smart grid applications.
IoT components may be poorly connected (dropped packets, interrupted connections).

Examples of IoT Applications

For this report, five significant IoT applications have been selected. They are sufficiently
representative to use in the analysis of the present state of IoT cybersecurity standardization.
Each application is explained below, including information about some of the notable security
challenges and potential solutions. Sections 6 and 7 of this report provide greater detail about
these challenges and solutions.
5.1

Connected Vehicles (CV)

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

In 1999, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allocated 75 MHz of spectrum in the
5.9 GHz band for use by Intelligent Transportations systems (ITS) for vehicle safety and
mobility applications. Since then, communications techniques, such as Dedicated Short Range
Communications (DSRC), are using this bandwidth for Connected Vehicle (CV) technology
pilots. CV technology is expected to enable vehicles, roads, and other infrastructure to
communicate and share vital transportation information. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicleto-infrastructure (V2I) studies are underway, including by the Intelligent Transportations
Systems Joint Program Office (ITS-JPO) at the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).

Figure 3 – Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications [9]

DSRC is currently part of a CV pilot run by DOT, which expects that a vehicle will use DSRC to
transmit its position, direction, and speed -- as well as other information -- to vehicles sharing the
road. DSRC will also “talk” to equipment installed in the road itself and in other infrastructure,
such as traffic signals, stop signs, toll booths, work or school zones, and railroad crossings [10].
One concept implementation of DSRC involves vehicles exchanging Basic Safety Messages
(BSM), which will be included with security credentials (see Figure 3, above). A possible
alternative to DSRC is a technology concept called Visible Light Communication (VLC). LED

10

NISTIR 8200

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

lights are increasingly being added to vehicles, and VLC can utilize these LED lights to
communicate in the V2V and V2I scenarios.
The Security Credential Management System (SCMS) Proof-of-Concept (POC) is under
development by DOT. One objective is to support a subset of security needs for the CV Pilots
Program. Each Pilot site must interface with and use the SCMS as part of its approach to address
at least a subset of the Pilot’s security requirements [11]. The goal of the SCMS POC design is to
provide security services to support V2V and V2I communications at current passenger-vehicle
production levels (up to 17 million annually) for the first year of deployment.
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

Figure 4 – V2X Public Key Infrastructure Overview [9]

An additional important goal of the SCMS POC system is to provide a flexible architecture that
is capable of scaling to support larger numbers of V2V and V2I devices in the years following
initial deployment [12]. The messages transmitted by vehicles are digitally signed for
authentication and to indicate that the messages were not altered in transit. See Figure 4, above,
for a V2V and V2I (consolidated as V2X) Public Key Infrastructure overview.
Significant privacy, safety, and security challenges associated with both of these projects remain.
These include policies and laws governing the use of the information within BSM, and the
security of BSMs, as well as the implementation and governance of a central Certificate
Authority (CA).
5.2

Consumer

The consumer IoT includes all IoT applications for consumer products. In the residence,
connected objects might include: thermostats, alarm systems, smoke detectors, doorbells, smart
11

NISTIR 8200

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

appliances (e.g., washers, dryers, refrigerators, ovens, televisions), door locks, door openers,
smart lightbulbs, room occupancy sensors, motion detectors, security cameras, pet monitors, and
baby monitors. Wearables for consumer use, such as smart wristwear and smart fabrics, as well
as implants, for applications such as consumer health or identification, are also part of the
consumer IoT. Smartphones often serve as the human user interface for these components, as do
smart home assistants.

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

Home assistants are increasingly common. They can provide information, perform tasks, and
control other IoT components. Home assistants often use conversational interfaces but can also
use text and images as input. These voice-enabled user interface devices can be placed
throughout a house. Every major smartphone operating system available today includes the
ability to control these home assistants, which may connect and control some or all IoT
components in the home.
Smart appliances can provide sensing and actuating capabilities, as well as a network interface.
Examples include cooking appliances that can be remotely programmed and monitored, and
refrigerators that alert the occupants when the milk is running low or the steak is going bad. A
smart home security system may alert the home occupant to a burglary, high carbon monoxide
levels, or a fire event, even if the occupant is not within the sounding alarm’s range (likely done
through text, email, or dedicated app). Smart homes may include systems for fire detection,
monitoring and communication for fire suppression, and alerting first responders. Chore
automation is a growing trend for IoT devices in the home; autonomous home appliances and
devices learn about users’ behaviors and identify the best time to perform tasks autonomously.
For example, a thermostat, linked to the owner opening the garage door, adjusts the home’s
temperature to the person’s liking. A refrigerator or kitchen cabinet may communicate with a
smartphone to place an order directly to a grocery delivery service.
While the idea of converting a home’s control to smart devices has benefits, some consumers
may be hesitant to embrace IoT-based systems if they perceive that their safety and privacy are at
risk. Proper implementation of security within consumer IoT software, firmware, and hardware
is often a neglected and overlooked priority. Securing IoT devices is a major challenge, and
manufacturers tend to focus on functionality, compatibility requirements, and time-to-market
rather than security. While the adoption of consumer IoT devices is expected to explode in the
near future, the increased popularity and acceptance by the consumer must be weighed against
security risks inherent to every device attached to a network.

Figure 5 – Home Lighting Application

Consumers may not be aware of the far-reaching security vulnerabilities introduced by
something as innocuous as connecting a smart LED bulb to the home network. A representative
diagram for connecting a smart LED bulb to a home network is shown in Figure 5, above.
Connecting a smart LED bulb illustrates typical network connectivity for a consumer IoT device.
The smart LED bulb allows the homeowner, via either a smartphone or remote control device, to
turn the bulb on or off as well as schedule its activation and deactivation. The homeowner can
access web services to store configurations of color, illumination intensity, and activation/
deactivation schedules. These web-stored configurations can be used to seamlessly restore
operation after a power outage.

STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

If a consumer IoT device becomes compromised, it can be a gateway into the broader network.
IoT threats could spread through networks and the Internet. By infecting a device and infiltrating
one network, the threat can spread to an entirely separate network just by being in wireless range
of another IoT device. In the case of a smart LED bulb, hackers in Wi-FiTM range can learn WiFiTM credentials sent in plain text and gain access to other systems and devices on the network
and Internet. Possible attacks can range from spoofing connections to enabling malicious
command and control of an IoT device by planting backdoors to create and launch an IoT
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. Securing IoT devices so that consumer safety and
privacy remains protected is a continuing challenge.

Health and Medical Devices

IoT has recently gained traction by its spread from manufacturing to the electrical grid and other
new sectors such as healthcare [13]. In the healthcare sector, health IoT components and systems
gather, transmit and analyze personal data derived from sources such as electronic health records
(EHR) containing personally identifiable information (PII), personal health records (PHR),
patient generated health data, and other machine-generated healthcare data. Health IoT will
support services such as real-time monitoring, medication compliance, and imaging.

Use Cases
Wireless telecommunications companies have developed smart sensors that support wearable,
implantable, injectable, and ingestible medical devices used in the healthcare industry, and
vendors have incorporated them into products such as insulin pumps, cochlear implants, and
pacemakers. Health IoT components “talk” to the Internet via a smart interactive interface
connected to the device’s firmware [14]. The following use cases are representative of services
that can be provided by the emerging health IoT.

An example scenario would be Alice is a disabled veteran who has been determined to have
hepatitis C [HCV] brought on by drug use related to combat-induced stress. As normal
treatments have failed, the Veterans Administration wants her to participate in a large-scale
hepatitis research program involving clinical trials of DNA matched treatments in an
environment containing data from hundreds of thousands of other patients. Emerging standards
for information sharing, such as Health Level 7’s (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability
Resource (FHIR), provide Internet addressable information flow. Sequenced DNA from
participant blood samples will be analyzed for efficacy of alternative hepatitis treatments. Alice
consents to participate in the clinical trial. She receives medicine reminders via cellphone or via
an IoT-enabled pillbox offering a wireless link to the patient, doctor, family members, and
monitoring center. The pillbox helps to ensure Alice complies with the strict medication regimen
times and sequences that are essential for the trial.
Diabetes Treatment
Alice has decided to travel outside of the United States but is diabetic and wants to monitor her

will proactively evaluate and personalize
her treatment, sending predictive alerts for
hypoglycemia and insulin dosage updates.

While still on travel Alice wants to know more about the nutrition aspects of the local food. She
downloads an app which can recognize typical ingredients of many available menu choices and,
when presented at the table, can estimate the caloric and nutritional values from the photo image
of her plate. This allows her to make more appropriate choices later in the day when she has her
next meal. The app also notes what she consumes and enters that data into a diabetes

Universal Control system reviews its business rules and informs the HVAC system controller
that a 20 % higher occupancy rate is expected. The system also checks the Hoteling Book-It
system to estimate power and ventilation demands of all pre-scheduled meetings. The HVAC
system initiates its cooling routines to compensate for the increased demand. As GSA staff and

Around 2 p.m., a significant cold front moves into the area. The building’s Weather Station
system, which is tied to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Internet
Weather Service, detects the drop in outside temperature and feeds that data to the Occupant
Interface Dashboard, which controls the Window Switch report and Shade Control system within
each zone floor plan. As the outside cloud cover increases, the window shades are raised
automatically, and the interior lights are increased by the Lutron Lighting Control System. After
a while, several users begin to complain that it is too cold. Individually, they open the building
control app and submit their requests to raise the temperature and increase the lighting in their
area. The system receives this feedback and averages the input from other users to make
adjustments, as well as record the information for future adjustments.
By now, the meeting in GSA’s largest conference room, reserved until 3 p.m., has ended. The
Hoteling Book-It system notifies the Universal Control system, which verifies that lack of
occupants. To conserve energy, the air conditioning is placed into standby state and lights are
turned off until the space is occupied again. At the end of the day, the facility manager reviews
energy consumption and checks tomorrow’s meeting calendar. The dashboard alerts the manager
to a large conference, with over 200 attendees, starting with a 7 a.m. breakfast. The manager
verifies that AC and ventilation will begin one hour earlier and adjusts the power metering to
ensure plug loads are adequate for the A/V equipment and number of devices expected.

Securing smart manufacturing assets requires a comprehensive security model based on a welldefined set of security policies. Given the human-to-machine and machine-to-machine interfaces,
a robust Security Management Plan must address people, process, and technology (Figure 10).
As security of organizations could be compromised at many layers, it is important to create a
single point of contact (individual or office) to coordinate security matters and report incidents.
Solutions are emerging that allow unified reporting to detect any threat to the application,
process, or network, providing granular visibility of traffic and alerts to deviations from baseline
operations and facilitating attack forensics.

Figure 10 – Security Management Plan

Currently, smart manufacturing environments are custom solutions that are complicated,
expensive, and built on specialized communications protocols. To achieve affordable plug-andplay capabilities, next generation hardware and software technologies need to work together
through common security and communication standards. Standardization would lower the cost of
entry to smart manufacturing for small and medium-sized businesses. In addition, as more cloud
technology and Internet connectivity is leveraged toward the Industrial IoT, a major challenge is
to assure the identity of the “things” in order to have secure exchanges of information.
A distributed global manufacturing ecosystem increases the challenge of intellectual property
protection. Engineers and operators are no longer under one roof but, rather, in different physical
locations or countries. The process of black-boxing intellectual property could be the norm, so
that no single entity has total exposure to the full process intellectual property. As some vendors
start to shift from providing physical parts to providing digital code that the end-user purchases
to make parts themselves, new business models and rules for protecting intellectual property will
also emerge out of necessity. For example, a 3D printer file may need not only to be encrypted
for security, but also may need to limit the number of times it may be printed.
Smart manufacturing includes software and sensors that allow for precise predictions of
maintenance needs, material demand, overtime, and other factors, based on data captured
through all points of production. However, the volume of unstructured data (e.g., emails, blogs,
webpages) that could be consumed in big-data projects creates new kinds of security challenges
and requires a new mindset toward data-centric security measures. Big data is too new for
security personnel to understand what constitutes normal behavior. Security professionals need
to comprehend the analytics and automation being applied to determine how best to protect a
big-data enterprise, because there is currently no practical way to fully maintain situational
awareness of the data at the accelerated rates of acquisition and change. With that level of

22

NISTIR 8200

understanding, organizations and vendors working in big data will continue to evolve their tools,
techniques, and best practices, which will benefit smart manufacturing security.

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

Combining the advantages of big data and mobile devices, augmented reality (AR) is being used
with increasing frequency on the shop floor, including as a training aid, maintenance aid, and
operational dashboard. While the virtual overlay of information provides many benefits, it also
opens up another vulnerable interface. For example, a hacker could compromise the output of an
AR system, tricking users into thinking computer-generated objects are real. AR applications
require access to a variety of sensor data such as video and audio feeds and geolocation; a
malicious application could leak a user’s field of view or location. AR solution vendors must
address head-on the potential privacy and security risks that this technology can introduce. Some
existing security controls and practices—such as encrypting wireless data transmissions—can
provide a degree of protection for AR system inputs and outputs. Organizations need to have
clear visions about how to overlay their existing security regimes onto the AR field.
The Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile, as presented in NISTIR 8183 [17], may
help to manage cybersecurity risks associated with implementing IoT technologies in
manufacturing environments. This “target” profile has been developed to help reduce
cybersecurity risk for manufacturers in a way that aligns with manufacturing sector goals and
industry best practices. It focuses on desired cybersecurity outcomes and can be used to identify
opportunities for improving the current cybersecurity posture of a manufacturing system. The
voluntary profile is meant to enhance, but not replace, current cybersecurity standards and
industry guidelines that the manufacturer is embracing.

IoT Cybersecurity Objectives, Risks, and Threats
Overview

Trustworthiness reflects the degree of confidence one has that the system performs as
expected—with regard to characteristics including safety, security, privacy, reliability and
resilience—in the face of environmental disruptions, human errors, system faults and attacks
[18]. Trustworthiness of IoT systems will require active management of risks for privacy, safety,
security, etc.
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

Cybersecurity is the prevention of damage to, unauthorized use of, exploitation of, and—if
needed—the restoration of electronic information and communications systems, and the
information they contain, in order to strengthen the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
these systems [3]. Cybersecurity risk management for IoT systems will continue to be a major
factor in the trustworthiness of IoT applications.
Cybersecurity Objectives
Confidentiality: Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure,
including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information;
Integrity: Guarding against improper information modification or destruction, and includes
ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity; and
Availability: Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.
Given that IT innovation is outpacing the development of supporting standards, it is critical to be
forward thinking about current and future cybersecurity needs. Cyber-attacks on one or more IoT
components already have had cyber and physical implications. Traditional IT security focuses on
confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Due to the nature of many IoT components, which
interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators, IoT security also addresses threats
to people, their objects, and their environment.
Cybersecurity objectives for traditional IT systems generally prioritize confidentiality, then
integrity, and lastly availability. IoT systems cross multiple sectors as well as use cases within
those sectors and their cybersecurity objectives may be prioritized very differently, depending on
the application. For some IoT applications, availability or integrity may be the highest priority.
“IIoT [Industrial IoT] organizations must place increased importance on safety and resilience
beyond the levels expected in many traditional IT environments. IIoT systems may also have
data flows that include intermediaries and involve multiple organizations, requiring more
sophisticated security approaches than, for example, link encryption. Unfortunately, IT
departments rarely speak the same language as those concerned with control systems and OT.
The two perceive risk differently, and they cannot be combined for positive gain without a
balanced consideration of their differing motivations [19].”
With the changing threat environment, the cybersecurity needs of the future—including the data
that informs, reports, and controls functionality of the IoT—should be considered. Privacy,

safety, authentication, and resilience contribute to IT and cybersecurity features. Evolutions in
system security engineering approaches can aid in reducing the susceptibility of systems to a
variety of simple, complex, and hybrid threats—including physical and cyber-attacks, structural
failures, natural disasters, and errors of omission and commission. This reduction in
susceptibility is accomplished by understanding stakeholder protection needs and employing
sound security design principles and concepts throughout the system life cycle.
The specific security objectives for industrial control systems in NIST SP 800-82 [20] can be

using unidirectional gateways, a demilitarized zone network architecture with firewalls to
prevent network traffic from passing directly between the corporate and IoT networks,
and having separate authentication mechanisms and credentials for users of the corporate
and IoT networks. An IoT system should use a network topology that has multiple layers,
with each layer’s security considered separately, so that all communication occurs with as
much security and reliability as afforded by the technology.



Restricting physical access to IoT network and components. Unauthorized physical
access to components could cause serious disruption of an IoT system’s functionality. A
combination of physical access controls should be used, such as locks, card readers,
and/or guards.



Protecting individual IoT components from exploitation. This includes deploying
security patches as expeditiously as possible, after testing them under field conditions;
disabling all unused ports and services and assuring that they remain disabled; restricting
IoT user privileges to only those that are required for each person’s role; tracking and
monitoring audit trails; preventing RF attacks and restricting physical access; and using
security controls such as antivirus software and file integrity checking software where
technically feasible to prevent, deter, detect, and mitigate malware.



Preventing unauthorized modification of data. This includes data that is in transit (at
least across the network boundaries) and at rest. Methods such as encryption and digital
signatures can be used to preserve the integrity of data.



Detecting security events and incidents. Detecting security events, which have not yet
escalated into incidents, can help defenders break the attack chain before attackers attain
their objectives. This includes the capability to detect failed IoT components, unavailable
services, and exhausted resources that are important to provide proper and safe
functioning of an IoT system.



Maintaining functionality during adverse conditions. This involves designing IoT
systems so that each critical component has a redundant counterpart. Additionally, if a
component fails, it should fail in a manner that does not generate unnecessary traffic on
IoT or other networks, or does not cause another problem elsewhere, such as a cascading
event. IoT system should also allow for graceful degradation such as moving from
“normal operation” with full automation to “emergency operation” with operators more
involved and less automation to “manual operation” with no automation.

Restoring the system after an incident. Incidents are inevitable, and an incident
response plan is essential. A major characteristic of a good security program is how
quickly an IoT system can be recovered after an incident has occurred.

Risks
For the purposes of this report, risk is a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by
a potential circumstance or event and is typically a function of: (i) the adverse impacts that
would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence. For
example, information security risks are those that arise from the loss of confidentiality, integrity,
or availability of information or information systems. Information security risks reflect the
potential adverse impacts to organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, or
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Risk
assessment is the process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing risks. Assessing risk
requires the careful analysis of threat and vulnerability information to determine the extent to
which circumstances or events could adversely impact an organization and the likelihood that
such circumstances or events will occur [21].
The proliferation and increased ubiquity of IoT components are likely to heighten the risks they
present; particularly as cyber criminals work to develop new generations of malware dedicated to
exploiting them. For instance, Dyn, a company that monitors and routes Internet traffic, was a
victim of a DDoS attack in October 2016. This attack included thousands of IoT components
infected with the “Mirai” malware. The torrent of traffic unleashed by the Mirai-infected IoT
components overwhelmed Dyn’s systems and, in turn, rendered unavailable many high-traffic
websites (e.g., PayPal, Twitter, Netflix, and CNN) that used Dyn’s Internet services for
substantial periods of the day. The disruption of Dyn and associated Internet services
underscores the significant, systemic harm that may be caused by malware dedicated to
exploiting the security vulnerabilities of IoT components.
As the market for IoT components expands, it is critical that manufacturers design components
with security in mind and that system designers pay attention to new attack surfaces—in addition
to evaluating the overall network risk.
To minimize impact of the multiplicity of risks associated with IoT, they should not be assessed
and monitored in isolation. Rather, they should be considered in the broader perspective of
enterprise risk to ensure all aspects of threat and vulnerability are addressed.
Threats
A threat is any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational
operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets,
individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized
access, destruction, disclosure, or modification of information, and/or denial of service [22].
Threats exist to and from the IoT. Data storage and communication must be protected even as
the growing quantity of components will increase the amount of data requiring protection.
Threats to people, their property, and their interactions within society are becoming more
abundant as a result of the growing attack surface.

Connected Vehicles

Cybersecurity Objectives
Confidentiality

V2V, V2I, and V2X communications require secure cryptographic
authentication.

Integrity

The contents of messages (e.g., BSM) require protection from
modification of the authentic information via cryptographic techniques.

Availability

The real-time nature of V2V, V2I, and V2X communications require
resilient and secure networks.

Vehicle manufacturers already focus on driver and passenger safety. Greater emphasis may be
required due to the increased attack surface from V2V, V2I, and V2X communications. Beyond
physical safety, there are privacy concerns. Users may connect and have access to their vehicles
through their smartphones personal information on these components needs to be protected from
unauthorized access through the vehicle. Similarly, the vehicle’s ability to perform as designed
and as intended by the user must be protected from threats that may come through the mobile
device.
Risks
Connected vehicles face many of the same risks as other IoT systems and cyber systems in
general. Severe safety consequences to vehicles and people require risk assessments to be
developed. Potential safety-critical risks include [23]:




Driver distractions (volume, wipers, etc.);
Engine shutoff or degradation; and
Steering changes (in drive-by-wire vehicles).

There are other risks less critical to safety, some of which are fairly unique to vehicles:




Theft of the car or its contents;
Enabling physical crimes against the occupants;
Insurance or lease fraud;

Physically damaging engine or other components, for example by constantly applying a
degree of braking pressure during normal operations.

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

Threats
The addition of Internet connectivity to “infotainment” consoles has already introduced threats to
driver and passenger safety as a result of communications between vehicle controls and
entertainment applications. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications introduce new attack vectors. The addition of
these communication channels brings an increased threat of spoofed, manipulated, damaged, and
missing sensors and actuators, which could cause vehicles to behave unpredictably.
Appropriate security measures must be taken within each subsystem, as well as any
communications or interactions between them. Protections must be made against user error,
device malfunction, and device damage, in addition to deliberate attacks by malicious actors
(e.g., disgruntled employees, agents of industrial espionage, and terrorists).
Additional threats include:
 Increased complexity of these dynamic networks may introduce vulnerabilities and
increase exposure to potential attackers and unintentional errors.
 Set-and-forget sensors will provide ample opportunities for capture and compromise
attacks to cause unexpected and unsafe behavior of vehicles.
 Threats to sensors and actuators risk harm to passengers and passersby in addition to
damage to vehicles and objects on and along the road.
 Location of the vehicle could be exposed through vulnerabilities in the vehicle’s
information system as well as those in mobile devices used to communicate with the
vehicle.
The Tampa Hillsborough Expressway Authority (THEA) CV Pilot Team [24] has assembled the
following lists of V2X threats:
 An attacker learns restricted information on the device/system, such as private keys,
certificates, etc., using a non- invasive attack such as a side channel attack and/or
cryptanalysis of algorithms and signed messages.
 An attacker learns restricted information on the device/system, such as private keys,
certificates, etc., using an invasive software attack such as malware (available on Internet
for example) that exploits vulnerabilities in algorithms and software.
 An attacker learns physically protected restricted information on the device, such as
private keys, using a physical attack.
 An attacker replays a BSM or other system message at a different (than original) time
and/or location.
 An attacker modifies the sensor inputs on a single device before the device uses them to
generate and send a BSM or other system message.
 An attacker modifies the sensor inputs to multiple devices before the device uses them to
generate and send a BSM or other system message (for example, by GPS spoofing).

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

An attacker is able to use restricted information on the device/system to create a false
BSM or other system message without actually extracting the information from the
device/system (e.g., use private key to sign a message without completing one of the
T.Extract attacks).
An attacker who knows about the misbehavior detection algorithms (and associated
parameters) manipulates the content of the BSM to evade detection.
An attacker who has been reported sending invalid messages denies that those messages
came from the attacker’s device, thwarting the misbehavior detection process.
An attacker who knows about the misbehavior detection algorithms (and associated
parameters) manipulates misbehavior reports to implicate innocent devices/systems and
evade detection.
An attacker uses the change pattern(s) of certificates and other BSM-relevant information
to track a vehicle or other device.
An attacker uses BSM data to track a vehicle/device.
An attacker installs malware on a device/system that prevents receiving, or making use
of, or providing user interaction based on BSMs or other system messages.
An attacker uses the device as an attack vector on the rest of the vehicle/system.
An attacker transmits noise and energy on the same frequency as the DSRC safety
channel.
An attacker transmits messages to jam or distract. These messages may contain incorrect
information but are validly signed or may appear valid but have a bad cert or signature.
Consumer

Cybersecurity Objectives
Confidentiality

Consumer IoT systems require preserving authorized restrictions on
access and disclosure to consumer data and services.

Integrity

Consumer IoT systems require the protection of data integrity and the
operation of other electronic components on the network.

Availability

Consumer IoT systems require continuity of operations for consumer
IoT components that are connected to the physical world.

The main cybersecurity objectives for Internet-connected consumer electronic components are
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of consumer data and services. These objectives can
intersect with consumer safety and privacy. The cybersecurity of an Internet-connected consumer
device is also important to depriving hackers of a conduit through which they may compromise
the data integrity and operation of other electronic components on the same network. In addition,
the burgeoning popularity of connected consumer components also makes them ripe targets for
criminals who seek to execute coordinated, widespread cyber-attacks that cause significant,
systemic harm across the Internet. Additionally, IoT components would benefit from "out of the
box" security, which requires immediate password change on first use. To achieve these security
objectives, consumer components should use secure and readily updatable firmware and robust
authentication practices, such as strong password or passphrase requirements. In some instances,
29

NISTIR 8200

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

using encryption or a virtual private network (VPN) connection to a local network may protect
against unauthorized eavesdropping and protect the login credentials of IoT consumer
components.

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

Risks
Consumer IoT components are challenged by many of the same cybersecurity risks as
computers, smartphones, and other categories of IoT components. For instance, to attack IoT
components, cyber criminals often probe the components for security vulnerabilities and then
install malicious software (“malware”) to surreptitiously control the device, damage the device,
gain unauthorized access to the data on the device, and/or otherwise affect the device’s operation
without permission. The risks posed by malware-infected IoT components, however, may be
more pronounced because their low costs and energy constraints often constrain the resources
that are invested in their cybersecurity and, therefore, make them ripe targets for hackers intent
on causing widespread harm. Indeed, given their growing volume, consumer IoT components are
increasingly targeted as a means for penetrating other electronic components on the same
network, or assembling an army of machines capable of transmitting Internet traffic without the
device owners’ knowledge as part of a DDoS attack.
Additional risks created by consumer IoT components include:









Risks to physical safety by small consumer IoT components that are connected to the
physical world and may be accessed or controlled remotely, such as smart ovens, stoves,
toasters, etc.;
Risks to property that may be caused by interrupting the operation of certain consumer
IoT components that are connected to the physical world, such as refrigerators,
thermostats, or washing machines;
Risks to privacy that may be caused by accessing and remotely controlling components
that are capable of collecting information about their surroundings, such as digital web
cameras, autonomous robotic vacuum cleaners, connected toys, etc.;
Risks to data security and privacy from consumer IoT components that collect a
substantial amount of personal information. While consumers stand to reap the greatest
benefits from the IoT, they will have to balance potential benefits with privacy concerns.
Consumers will have to be discerning about how they engage with that information and
with whom they share it;
Risks to other components on the network by creating a variety of new interconnection
between components and drastically expanding the attack surface of consumer/home
networks;
Risks to privacy by exposing login information for various consumer accounts that are
stored on consumer IoT components; and
Risks of side-channel attacks that could lead to physical intrusions of consumer premises
and loss of property.

Threats
Without adequate cybersecurity safeguards, even inexpensive, consumer IoT components with
limited functionalities may be exploited to threaten confidentiality, integrity, availability of
consumer data and services, consumer privacy and safety, and other systems on the Internet. For

30

NISTIR 8200

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

instance, as detailed above, the disruption of Internet services in October 2016 by a DDoS attack
underscores the significant, systemic harm that insecure IoT components may cause. Further, as
connected IoT technologies progressively extend their reach to consumer components critical to
basic home functions (e.g., the connected thermostat), cyber criminals may increasingly target
them in ransomware attacks or other traditional cyber-attacks directed to collecting highlysensitive personal information. Personal privacy and safety may also be compromised by the
interruption of certain consumer IoT components (e.g., the connected oven) or certain sidechannel attacks, such as a prospective burglar monitoring communication between and the
operations of components to determine the whereabouts of a homeowner.

Health and Medical Devices

Cybersecurity Objectives
Confidentiality

Health IoT requires the protection of patient information from
unauthorized disclosure and access.

Integrity

Health IoT requires the protection of patient safety from unauthorized
modification of the intended use of the medical device.

Availability

Health IoT requires that patient information is available to authorized
entities when it is needed and that the medical device’s functionality
continues to be available when needed.

The security objectives of health information technology (HIT) revolve around the
implementation of security controls that provide for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
of patient information and for the systems supporting the use and exchange of that information.
The security objectives of medical devices are concentrated around patient safety aspects and
concentrate more on Integrity and Availability.
Major security objectives for this application area include the following:
 Protect patient safety from network originated inauthentic commands to actuators;
 Protect patient sensor data from tampering to allow correct algorithmic response;
 Protect medical device processing capability;
 Protect patient data where the data forms part of a treatment and monitoring regime;
 Protect patient information from unauthorized disclosure or modification;
 Ensure patient information is available to authorized entities when it is needed;
 Ensure prompt and secure patch delivery to medical devices;
 Ensure continuous security risk management throughout the device lifecycle;
 Explore and promote, where appropriate, existing and emerging technologies to enhance
security and confidentiality of health information; and
 Educate HIT practitioners and consumers on security and privacy issues related to the
uses of HIT and protected health information.
Risks [25]
Cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities can impact the safety of IT networks and the medical
devices and other systems connected to these networks. However, medical devices and the IT

networks they connect to are unique. In addition to data security and privacy impacts, patients
may be physically affected (i.e., illness, injury, death) by cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities
of medical devices. This harm may stem from the performance of the device itself, inaccurate
information, or the inability to deliver timely care. As a result, addressing the patient privacy and
safety risks posed by cyber threats are of paramount importance.

access to any building control system.
Integrity

Smart buildings require the protection of building control system
information from unauthorized modification.

Availability

Smart buildings require that building control system information is
available to authorized entities when it is needed.

Preventing unauthorized access to any building control system is paramount to securing smart
buildings. Thus, the main objective must be to protect the interfaces to and between each system,
even when they may be overlaid on top of one another. A domino effect caused by the
compromise of one system leading to the compromise of another cannot be allowed happen. It is
also important for fail-safes and backup systems to be in place in the event of a malfunction of
any one of the systems. Since some of these systems may be dynamic and impossible to model in
each-and-every scenario, robust modeling and testing must be done to handle foreseeable
situations. Occupant safety is also a vital objective.
Risks
Smart buildings may contain several sets of IoT components that each have their own security
objectives, risks, and threats. They include infrastructure, networked, people, digital transducers,
computing resources, and combined systems. This heterogeneity is a challenge with securing
smart buildings. Interoperability between systems and components from different vendors may
introduce weaknesses for an attacker to exploit. The interfaces between these different
components may present vulnerabilities; once one system becomes compromised, it may be an
avenue for an attacker to traverse laterally into another. On the other hand, homogeneous
networks also can be vulnerable because they can be subject to single points of failures. The
dynamic nature of these networks presents additional difficulties. As employees and visitors
33

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY

move around inside and around the building, the components they carry may be interacting with
various networks. Vulnerabilities may be missed since every scenario cannot be tested.
Appropriate security policies and security awareness programs, particularly focused on Bring
Your Own Device risks, can help mitigate the risk of employee and visitor device interactions
with building networks.
Threats
In addition to threats and vulnerabilities arising from the many IoT systems in a smart building,

Smart Manufacturing

Cybersecurity Objectives
Confidentiality

Smart Manufacturing requires the protection of manufacturing
information from unauthorized disclosure and access.

Integrity

Smart Manufacturing requires the protection of manufacturing
information from unauthorized modification.

Availability

Smart Manufacturing requires that manufacturing information is
available to authorized entities when it is needed. This includes
information processed within milliseconds so that it is available
virtually immediately.

Today’s manufacturing environment poses unique cybersecurity challenges beyond the
considerable technical complexities of cyber-physical systems. These challenges stem from
fundamental differences between IT and OT. Too often, organizational stovepipes separate
engineering, management and decision-making processes for enterprise business operations and
the production environment, a problem exacerbated by the inherently change- and risk-averse
culture on the shop floor. In the past 30 years, adaptation has meant integrating advanced
technologies involving computer-based systems into the manufacturing processes. Today, the

34

line from design to production to distribution to employment of goods may begin in one part of
the country (or the globe) and extend across the nation (or across continents).
Risks

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

The emerging digital manufacturing environment, often referred to as Industry 4.0, includes
technologies such as automation, cyber-physical systems, cloud computing. New technologies
allow manufacturers to produce reliable products efficiently and safely to adapt to changing
requirements from both civilian and military customers. But with this integration and flexibility
comes the potential for malicious actors to infiltrate key systems by gaining access to
manufacturing networks. When successful, these actors may extort ransom from a company to
release the system from their control, copy sensitive proprietary information that can be sold to
other companies or other governments, or install software that can affect a product’s
performance. The potential consequences for national security are compelling.
Equally troubling is the fact that adversaries who penetrate the security systems in processes
used to produce arms and equipment for the U.S. military may have the capability to alter or halt
production processes to affect these items’ reliability, safety, or security, putting the lives of
service personnel at risk and materially degrading the ability of the nation’s fighting forces to
succeed on the battlefield.
Threats
Managing a modern manufacturing enterprise exposes the data exchanged by designers, the
production team, and those involved in the supply chain to attacks. These attacks can be made by
individuals or state actors, intent on stealing intellectual property, damaging the United States’
competitive advantage, or sabotaging mission-critical components. Similar to emerging
cybersecurity concerns related to the rapid expansion of the commercial IoT, as the number of
factory floor device connections grows, the cyber-attack surface expands and requires new
cybersecurity protections for confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as well as, prevention of
distributed denial of service (DDoS) and other attacks that require the use of distributed devices.

Cybersecurity Areas and IoT

Annex D provides an annotated listing of standards relevant for the following areas in this
section.
7.1

Cryptographic Techniques

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

Cryptographic techniques are integral to securing IoT data and transactions. Conventional
cryptographic techniques are appropriate for some IoT implementations, but due to the
constrained environments of many IoT applications, new adaptions of cryptographic techniques
are being pursued to support cybersecurity within IoT environments.
IoT cybersecurity rests on three fundamental security objectives: confidentiality, integrity, and
availability, known as the CIA triad. CIA is defined and discussed in Section 6. Fundamentally,
the goal of cybersecurity is to prevent unauthorized viewing (confidentiality) and modification
(integrity) of data while safeguarding authorized access (availability).
Cryptographic techniques that provide confidentiality and integrity include encryption, digital
signatures, and message authentication codes (MACs). Encryption provides confidentiality to
data in motion, data at rest, and data in use. A digital signature provides authentication, integrity,
and non-repudiation, MACs provide authenticity and integrity protection, but not nonrepudiation protection.
Cryptographic techniques do not directly provide for availability, the third security objective;
however, availability can be detrimentally affected by defective implementations of
cryptographic techniques. For example, if keys are not properly synchronized, the secure
communications link will be inoperable, causing unavailability.
Encryption
Cryptographic algorithm standards have been widely available for some time. For example, the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) block cipher, included in International Organization for
Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 18033-3:2010, is the
preferred block cipher for Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 to
secure wireless networks, and is required to implement in version 1.2 of the Internet Engineering
Task Force’s (IETF) Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.
Public key cryptography standards have also been widely available. IETF has been developing
public key cryptography standards for Internet applications. The IEEE 1363 working group has
been publishing standards for public key cryptography including:


STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

IEEE 1363-2013 Cor.

Lightweight cryptography standards are needed for emerging areas in which highly constrained
devices are interconnected, typically communicating wirelessly with one another, working in
concert to accomplish some task. Examples of these areas include: sensor networks, healthcare,
distributed control systems, IoT, cyber-physical systems, and the smart grid. Security and
privacy can be very important in these areas. Because most modern cryptographic algorithms
were designed for desktop/server environments, many of these algorithms cannot be
implemented in the devices used by these applications [26].

Digital Signatures
A digital signature is an electronic analogue of a written signature and provides assurance that
the claimed signatory signed the information and that the information was not modified after
signature generation. Digital signatures are used in technologies including Connected Vehicle
Systems and in cryptographic-enabled protocols such as internet protocol security (IPSEC),
secure/multipurpose internet mail extensions (S/MIME), and transport layer security (TLS).
Example implementations include using digital signatures to authenticate from one machine to
another, sign software/firmware to verify source and integrity, and sign PKI public key
certificates. Common digital signature algorithms include:



7.2

RSA with Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) 1 or probabilistic signature
scheme (PSS) padding schemes;
DSA (digital signature algorithm) (FIPS 180-4); and
Elliptic curve DSA (ECDSA) (FIPS 186-4).
Cyber Incident Management

Cyber incident management standards support information sharing processes, products, and
technology implementations for cyber incident identification, handling, and remediation. Such
standards enable organizations to identify when a cyber incident has occurred, to properly
respond to that incident, and recover from any losses as a result of the incident. Such standards
are one method to enable jurisdictions to exchange information about incidents, vulnerabilities,

threats and attacks, the system(s) that were exploited, security configurations and weaknesses
that could be exploited, etc.
While it is important that each organization has an internal process to monitor the IoT
environment health and detect anomalies, it is necessary to establish a process to encourage
external reports of vulnerabilities and risks. Such a process enables an organization to triage
external reports in a timely matter for appropriate actions

While higher-level standards for cyber incident management are available, emerging low-level
standards and implementations are under development that will facilitate the automated
exchange of incident-related data such as indicators of compromise; tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs); threat actors; and courses of action. Existing standards include:
 ISO/IEC 27035:2016, Information technology – Security techniques – Information
security incident management – Part 1;
 ISO/IEC 27035-2:2016, Information technology – Security techniques – Information
security incident management – Part 2;
 ITU-T X.1056, Security incident management guidelines for telecommunications
organizations;
 Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) v3;
 ISO/IEC 29147: 2014, Information technology – Security techniques – Vulnerability
disclosure;
 ISO/IEC 30111: 2013, Information technology – Security techniques – Vulnerability
handling process;
 IETF Request for Comments (RFC) 4765, Intrusion Detection Message Exchange
Format (IDMEF);
 IETF RFC 5070, Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF);
 IETF RFC 5901, Extensions to the IODEF for Reporting Phishing;
 IETF RFC 6545, Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID);
 OASIS Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) Version 2.0; and
 OASIS Trusted Automated Exchange of Indicator Information (TAXII) Version 2.0.
IT cyber incident management procedures are relatively well understood. For industrial control
systems (ICS), the procedures are not so well understood, specifically related to what critical
infrastructure organizations should do in the event of a cyber incident. Shutting down a
continuously operating plant has its own risks—commercial and safety—and careful
consideration and consensus are required to identify scenarios and recommended courses of
action.

Hardware Assurance

Hardware assurance is an activity to ensure a level of confidence that microelectronics (also
known as microcircuits, semiconductors, and integrated circuits, including embedded software
and/or intellectual property) function as intended and are free of known vulnerabilities, either
intentionally or unintentionally designed or inserted as part of the system’s hardware and/or its
embedded software and/or intellectual property, throughout the life cycle.

Identity and Access Management

Identity and access management and related standards help to enable the use of secure,
interoperable digital identities and attributes of entities to be used across security domains and
organizational boundaries. Examples of entities include people, places, organizations, hardware
devices, software applications, information artifacts, and physical items. Standards for identity
and access management support identification, authentication, authorization, privilege
assignment, and audit to ensure that entities have appropriate access to information, services, and
assets. In addition, many identity and access management standards include privacy features to
maintain anonymity, unlinkability, untraceability, ensure data minimization, and require explicit
user consent when attribute information may be shared among entities.
Significant identity and access management standards are included in risk management
techniques and specifications to assert identity and authentication, as well as enforce access
policy on a range of platforms. Mature enterprise standards such as Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP), Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and the family of
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) cryptographic techniques to authenticate users and devices are
widely deployed and in use in the cloud-computing key IT application. Emerging standards are
being developed to abstract authentication form factors away from applications, allowing a rich
set of strong credentials to be interoperable online.
Risk-based approaches to determine assurance levels required to protect online transactions, and
the associated technical and procedural controls, have been adopted at the federal level and
similar standards ratified within international standards organizations. However, international
government identity programs are developing their own standards and guidelines rather than
adopting a smaller set of existing standards. In the private sector, industry has developed profiles
to meet the needs of their business model and partners, as well as their risk tolerance, but there is
not agreement among organizations as to which identity assurance standard is the most holistic
and therefore capable of being adopted cross-industry.
Standards to enforce access policies, share attributes, preserve anonymity, minimize data release,
and consent are still immature, difficult to deploy, and not available by a large majority of

software-as-a-service providers and traditional enterprise product vendors, additionally
hampering adoption.
Health information technology (health IT) [27] is standardizing authentication, consent, and
authorization to medical records across patients, providers, insurers, and research entities to
secure use and sharing of health information.
With the increase of commercial and enterprise Internet-connected devices (such as IoT
components), standards for device identity, outside of traditional PKI, are just being researched,
but the market has yet to determine what, if any that exist, will be leveraged.

PKI architecture for privacy: PKI is traditionally implemented to provide a trusted identity to
either an individual or device. However, the ability to remain anonymous and to not be tracked
while operating in network and RF environments is becoming more and more important.
7.5

Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)

Information security management system (ISMS) standards provide a set of processes and
corresponding security controls to establish a governance, risk, and compliance structure for
information security for an organization, an organizational unit, or a set of processes controlled
by a single organizational entity. An ISMS requires a risk-based approach to security that
involves selecting specific security controls based on the desired risk posture of the organization
and requires measuring effectiveness of security processes and controls. An ISMS requires a
cycle of continual improvement for an organization to continue assessing security risks,
assessing controls, and improving security to remain within risk tolerance levels by balancing
security and risk tolerances.
The ISO/IEC 27000 series provides best practice recommendations on information security
management, risks, and controls within the context of an overall information security
management system. The fundamental parts of this series are broadly applicable to IT systems
and applications.
ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Information technology - Security techniques - Information security
management systems – Requirements provides a model for establishing, implementing,
operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving an information security
management system (ISMS).
Because of some distinctive attributes of cloud computing, several standards have been approved
or are under development for cloud computing applications. These include:

7.6

IT System Security Evaluation

IT system security evaluation and assurance standards are used to provide: security assessment
of systems, security requirements for cryptographic modules, security tests for cryptographic
modules, automated security checklists, and security metrics.
There is a growing portfolio of standards for testing and validation of cryptographic modules that
are being widely applied. Approved standards include:
 ISO/IEC 19790:2015 Security requirements for cryptographic modules;
 ISO/IEC 24759:2014 Test requirements for cryptographic modules;
 ISO/IEC 17825:2016 Information technology – Security techniques – Testing methods

Standards for the security assessment of systems have been revised several times. These include
the three-part standard ISO/IEC 15408, Information technology – Security techniques –
Evaluation criteria for IT security.
In addition, certain process evaluation programs should be considered. One program for
mitigating the risk of maliciously tainted and counterfeit parts in IT products, to help assure
security and integrity in these products, is ISO/IEC 20243-2:2018 Information technology -Open Trusted Technology ProviderTM Standard (O-TTPS) -- Mitigating maliciously tainted and
counterfeit products -- Part 2: Assessment procedures for the O-TTPS and ISO/IEC 202431:2018. As noted under the ISMS core area above, this standard identifies secure engineering
best practices, including secure management of the IT products, components, and their supply
chains. While it does not cover product evaluations, it does provide for process evaluation. Such
evaluations determine if a technology provider, component supplier, or distributor meets all the
process requirements in the standard throughout a product’s life-cycle (design through disposal).
This would include the product development and secure engineering methods they use and the
supply chain security they provide.
These above standards are broadly applicable to the evaluation of security properties of IT
products.
7.7

Network Security

Network security standards provide security requirements and guidelines on processes and
methods for the secure management, operation and use of information, information networks,
and their inter-connections. Such standards-based technologies can help to assure the
confidentiality and integrity of data in motion, assure electronic commerce, and provide for a
robust, secure and stable network and Internet.
IoT networks are deployed using a multitude of protocols and physical links. Selecting the
appropriate messaging and communication protocols depends on the use case and security
requirements for each system.
One characteristic of IoT is the potential for spontaneous connections (due to the networking)
without a system view. Viewed in this way the IoT could not be ‘planned’ nor secured well using
traditional approaches to security since system compositional or emergent properties would
never be seen by a risk manager. The network interfaces in these loosely coupled systems
represent attack surfaces. Therefore, without a system asset definition and subsequent threat
analysis the security design is very unlikely to be useful.
42

NISTIR 8200

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

Radio Frequency (RF) connections may be based on industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM)
radio band, cellular data, or other standards. RF interference should be considered as a source of
risk for IoT deployments. Individual sensors may be disabled or degraded by RF interference.
This could be inadvertent, e.g., use of a poorly shielded microwave oven near an IP based
security camera; or malicious, e.g., use of a cell-phone jammer to prevent long-term evolution
(LTE)-connected motion sensors from transmitting activity to a security officer monitoring
station

Annex D lists the standards of the common protocols that support IoT communications and
establish the security of the underlying network connections. These protocols extend over the
Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layers, i.e., physical, link, network, transport, and
application layers.
A variety of organizations are involved in developing network security standards. The IETF
developed RFC 2196 provides a general and broad overview of information security including
network security, incident response, or security policies. IETF Security Area Working Groups
include: IP Security Maintenance and Extensions, Kitten (GSS-API Next Generation), Managed
Incident Lightweight Exchange, Network Endpoint Assessment, Open Authentication, and
Transport Layer Security.
ISA/IEC-62443 standards series define procedures for implementing electronically secure
industrial automation and control systems.
The IEEE standard, 802.11i-2004, implemented as Wi-FiTM Protected Access II (WPA2). This
amendment to IEEE 802.11 defined Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) and Counter Mode
Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP), which provided more
robust data protection mechanisms than Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) affords. The current
version of IEEE 802.11 is IEEE 802.11™-2016: IEEE Standard for Information technology –
Telecommunications and information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area
networks – Specific requirements – Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and
Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications.
7.8

Physical Security

Physical security standards provide requirements and guidance to prevent unauthorized
personnel, attackers or accidental intruders from physically accessing an area, building, room,
computer, etc. Such standards can help to ensure that IoT components are not disabled or
replaced it with a component that serves the same purpose but is compromised. IoT components
may be distributed over a wide area, a remote location or an unattended location where physical
access is difficult to restrict.
There are broadly applicable physical security standards, such as ANSI/ASIS PAP.1-2012
Security Management Standard: Physical Asset Protection. This standard provides a
management approach for the protection of assets by the application of security measures for
physical asset protection that can be applied to IoT components and systems.

43

NISTIR 8200

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

There are some specific physical security standards that are applicable to IoT components, such
as INCITS/ISO/IEC TS 30104:2015 (2017) Information Technology - Security Techniques Physical Security Attacks, Mitigation Techniques and Security Requirements. This standard
describes physical security mechanisms for cryptographic modules where the protection of the
modules sensitive security parameters is desired.
7.9

Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM)

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) standards describe protocols and data
formats that enable the ongoing, automated collection, monitoring, verification, and maintenance
of software, system, and network security configurations, and provide greater awareness of
vulnerabilities and threats to support organizational risk management decisions. Automation
protocols also include standards for machine-readable vulnerability identification and metrics,
platform and asset identification, actionable threat information and policy triggers for actions to
respond to threats and policy violations. Automated activities would include a security operation
center (SOC) to ensure autonomous and continuing monitoring and evolution of the security
state of assets based upon prescribed events.
While higher-level standards for security automation and continuous monitoring are available
and low-level specifications and implementations are in use, they require maturation and
shepherding through international standards developing organizations.
Existing standards include a large body of work under ISO/IEC, IETF, and industry-led efforts
(e.g., Cloud Security Alliance, Health Information Trust Alliance [HITRUST], North American
Electric Reliability Corporation [NERC] Critical Infrastructure Protection [CIP]) related to asset,
configuration, and vulnerability management—the underpinning of a continuous monitoring
capability. Other standards include those being developed by the IETF Security Automation and
Continuous Monitoring (SACM) Working Group.
As with incident management, IT security automation and continuous monitoring is relatively
well developed. Security automation and continuous monitoring is much more difficult to
implement in ICS. Disruption of finely balanced network communications timing and the lack of
in-depth understanding of industrial communications protocols are two major limiting factors
that will need to be addressed before this security barrier is more widely used.
7.10 Software Assurance

Software assurance standards describe requirements and guidance for significantly decreasing
the likelihood of software having vulnerabilities, either intentionally designed into the software
or accidentally inserted at any time during its life cycle, and that the software functions in the
intended manner. This includes custom software, commercial off-the-shelf software, firmware,
operating systems, utilities, databases, applications and applets for the Web,
software/platform/infrastructure as a service (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS), mobile and consumer devices,
etc.
It is important to have in place software assurance standards that provide assurance over the full
lifecycle of software. Software assurance across the life cycle includes threat modeling,
use/misuse cases, secure design, defensive design, and secure coding expectations that can be
44

validated using source code and binary analysis techniques. The integrity of the code is also
considered an aspect of software assurance. ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 Information technology –
Software asset management – Part 2: Software identification tag can be used to identify
software, measure the integrity of software distributions and installations, and to detect and
manage missing software patches for deployed software. Further work is needed to either apply
this existing standard to cloud deployments or to identify additional approaches that address
software and service deployments in cloud scenarios. Other relevant standards include:

7.11 Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM)

Supply chain risk management (SCRM) standards aim to provide the confidence that
organizations will produce and deliver information technology products or services that perform
as required. They seek to mitigate supply chain-related risks, such as insertion of counterfeits and
malicious software, unauthorized production, tampering, theft, and poor quality products and
services. IT SCRM standardization requirements include methodologies and processes that
enable an organization’s increased visibility into, and understanding of, how technology that they
acquire and manage is developed, integrated, and deployed, as well as the processes, procedures,
and practices used to assure the integrity, security, resilience, and quality of the products and
services. IT SCRM standardization lies at the intersection of cybersecurity and supply chain
management and provides a mix of mitigation strategies from both disciplines for a targeted
approach to managing IT supply chain risks.
45

NISTIR 8200

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

There are two high-level SCRM standards available: The Open Group standard is focused on IT
providers (not the acquirer), and the multipart standard, ISO/IEC 27036, covers information
security for supplier relationships.

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

The Open Group standard has been approved as ISO/IEC 20243:2015 Information Technology –
Open Trusted Technology Provider™ Standard (O-TTPS) – Mitigating maliciously tainted and
counterfeit products). The requirements cover best practices for product development, secure
methodologies, and supply chain security—from design through disposal. The Open Group OTTPS conformance assessment program is for providers, component suppliers, integrators, and
distributors of IT. It is not applicable to acquirers.
ISO/IEC 27036 has four parts:





ISO/IEC 27036-1:2014 Information technology – Security techniques – Information
security for supplier relationships – Part 1: Overview and concepts;
ISO/IEC 27036-2:2014 Information technology – Security techniques – Information
security for supplier relationships – Part 2: Requirements;
ISO/IEC 27036-3:2013 Information technology – Security techniques – Information
security for supplier relationships – Part 3: Guidelines for information and
communication technology supply chain security; and
ISO/IEC 27036-4:2016 Information technology – Security techniques – Information
security for supplier relationships – Part 4: Guidelines for security of cloud services.

In a couple of cases, standards developers are focused on SCRM for specific applications, such
as ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) for cloud computing and IEC Technical
Committee (TC) 65 for industrial-process measurement, control and automation for industrial
control systems (ICS). While any organization and any application would benefit from
implementing those broad-based standards immediately, there is still a need for defining
additional application specific requirements, which could be achieved either by evolving these
standards, or by developing more specific standards to supplement or overlay these.
ISO 28000:2007 Specification for security management systems for the supply chain specifies
the requirements for a security management system, including those aspects critical to security
assurance of the supply chain. This is a generic standard for security management of supply
chain. It is not specific for cybersecurity.
7.12 System Security Engineering

System security engineering standards describe planning and design activities to meet security
specifications or requirements for the purpose of reducing system susceptibility to threats,
increasing system resilience, and enforcing organizational security policy. A comprehensive
system security engineering effort:

Standards Landscape for IoT Cybersecurity

Annex C of this report—An IT Standards Maturity Model— provides a classification system for
characterizing the present state of market impact of a standard or draft standard. The standards
listed in Annex D–IoT Standards Mapping to Core Areas of Cybersecurity, have been collected
by the IoT Task Group. They are the basis for the following observations on the present state of
standards availability and standards use for IoT systems.

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

For the possible standard gaps identified in Section 8, agencies should further review these gaps
with respect to their respective missions. For identified priorities, agencies should work with the
private sector to initiate new projects in Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) to close
such gaps.
8.1

Cryptographic Techniques

Cryptographic techniques will need adjustments and innovations to accommodate the IoT.
Scalability, performance, memory- and power-limited devices, and constrained communication
channels all contribute to the cryptographic challenges associated with the IoT. The need for
cryptographic algorithms that can work within the confines of a simple electronic device is
motivating development of standardized “lightweight cryptography” (LWC). LWC does not
imply lightweight security. Rather, the “lightweight” concept refers to design constraints on
LWC algorithms evaluated in two separate contexts: software and hardware. In software LWC
implementations, smaller code and/or RAM size are preferable. Important measures for hardware
LWC implementations are chip size and/or energy consumption.
In some implementations, existing cryptographic standards can support IoT systems. For
instance, IoT devices that possess the required resources can use the Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) block cipher, a symmetric key encryption algorithm specified in ISO/IEC
18033-3:2010. Additionally, substantial effort has gone into reshaping AES into a solution for
lightweight applications. The AES standard has widespread market acceptance.
Other standards have been developed to specifically support IoT systems. For example, the
multipart ISO/IEC 29167 standard provides cryptographic options for the air interface of radiofrequency identification (RFID) components and the multipart ISO/IEC 29192 standard for
lightweight cryptography provides cryptographic options for IoT components with constrained
processing capabilities. Market acceptance for parts of these standards has not yet occurred.
Public-key cryptography (PKC), ubiquitous on the Web, may appear as a natural choice since the
inconvenience and restrictions of shared secrets are eliminated. However, the computational
demands of public-key cryptography, which may not be feasible for tiny IoT devices, must be
weighed against the key management and protocol limitations that come with symmetric key
cryptography. As an example, and given the immense scale envisioned for IoT applications,
certificate revocation, which include resource-hungry activities such as the processing and
storage associated with certificate revocation lists (CRLs) or the bandwidth associated with
Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), would have to be compared to the manual process
and vulnerability of symmetric key distribution and update.

48

NISTIR 8200

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

Existing standards and those being developed address these concerns. Elliptic curve
cryptography (ECC), defined in accepted standards such as ISO/IEC 29192-4:2013, is a publickey approach that provides well understood levels of security with smaller keys and signatures
than, for example, RSA. ECC has also become entrenched as a "must implement" mechanism in
many Internet protocols, such as TLS (RFC 5246), DTLS (RFC 6347), and the Internet Key
Exchange for IPsec (RFC 7296). For symmetric key applications (either alone or in conjunction
with PKC), light-weight algorithms are defined in ISO/IEC 29192-2. These symmetric ciphers
are tuned for limited power devices. Key management guidance is available in publications such
as NIST Special Publication 800-57.

Market Impact?
The AES standard has widespread market acceptance, including testing and validation of
thousands of implementations, which indicates a strong market impact. In contract, some of the
recently approved RFID and lightweight cryptographic standards have no or few commercial
implementations.
Possible Standards Gaps?
Blockchain is an evolving technology that could revolutionize IoT security. The blockchain
model favors peer-to-peer interactions between devices and thus de-centralizes security. Because
blockchain is still evolving and its applicability to security mechanisms is still not well
understood, no standards exist for using blockchain in a regular interoperable fashion. However,
the potential is significant enough that SDOs should be taking note.
8.2

Cyber Incident Management

There are many standards for cyber incident management that cover cyber incident
identification, handling, and remediation. Many are applicable to IoT systems. Examples
include: HITRUST CSF v9 for reporting information security incidents and weaknesses; IETF
RFC 5070 – 2007 for sharing information about computer security incidents; ISO/IEC 29147:
2014 and ISO/IEC 30111: 2013 for vulnerability disclosure and handling process; Organization
for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) OpenC2 (draft) for machine
to machine exchange of commands to achieve investigative, remediation and/or mitigation
effects; and OpenFog Reference Architecture (RA) (February 2017) for tamper response. Some
of these standards have widespread market acceptance.
Market Impact
Market implementations are lagging for cyber incident management for IoT systems. Some IoT
systems are not able to use software patches to fix cybersecurity flaws. In such cases, cyber
incident management is important for identifying incidents, but remediation may require
replacing IoT components. Replacement could be time-consuming and expensive.
Possible Standards Gaps
Some IoT systems are not able to use software patches to fix cybersecurity flaws. New standards
development could be undertaken to address remediation (compensating controls) when software
patches are not feasible.

NISTIR 8200

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

There are no standards for performing forensics on IoT devices. This lack of standards will
create an immense burden when responding to incidents involving IoT devices. This risk can be
mitigated by developing standards and tools that address the storage and access of forensic data
that will be available for post-mortem analysis.
8.3

Hardware Assurance

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

ISO/IEC JTC 1 has developed several standards relevant to hardware assurance such as:
ISO/IEC 27036, a multipart information security management system standard for supplier
relationships; and ISO/IEC 20243:2015, for secure engineering best practices, including secure
management of the IT products, components, and their supply chains. SAE International has over
ten approved or draft standards dealing with counterfeit electronic parts, such as AS5553B
(2016), Fraudulent/Counterfeit Electronic Parts; Avoidance, Detection, Mitigation, and
Disposition Verification Criteria.
Market Impact
Detecting malware in software is technically challenging and expensive when it comes to
firmware, and could slow down market uptake of relevant standards.
Possible Standards Gaps
Developing best practices for avoiding malware in firmware could be an area for new standards
development.
8.4

Identity and Access Management

There are many identity and access management standards with guidance available. Many of
these standards have been developed to specifically support IoT systems or specific IoT
applications. As in the case of the other core areas of cybersecurity, standards are being
developed by many SDOs. Examples include: Fast Identity Online Alliance (FIDO); Universal
Authentication Framework (UAF) v1.1 Specifications; HITRUST CSF v9; IEEE 802.1X-2004
for port based network access control; Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) SPEC 1.0 for
access control; the IETF RFC 7925 to authenticate and to negotiate cryptographic algorithms and
keys; and the Thread Specifications for home and building IoT applications.
Market Impact
The impact is unknown.
Possible Standards Gaps
Existing standards should be reviewed to determine if they are sufficient or require revision for
IoT systems.
8.5

Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)

There are several ISMS standards with market acceptance that are generally applicable to IoT
systems or specific IoT applications. The ISA/IEC 62443 series includes security management
requirements for Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS). ISO 13485:2016 provides

50

NISTIR 8200

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

management requirements for medical devices and related services. ISO 27799:2016 covers
information security management in health using ISO/IEC 27002. ISO/IEC 20243:2015
identifies secure engineering best practices, including secure management of the IT products,
components, and their supply chains. ISO/IEC 27001:2013 provides best practices for
implementing an ISMS and is being widely used. ISO/IEC 27002:2013 is also being widely used
as a reference for selecting security controls when implementing an ISMS.
Market Impact
Existing standards are being implemented.
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

Possible Standards Gaps
While there are specific management system standards for some IoT applications, there are other
IoT applications that could possibly benefit from a management system standard based upon
ISO/IEC 27002. Although ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 are widely used, the widespread
adoption of these standards to IoT has not yet occurred.
A new area of work could be to develop IoT security controls overlay where they would not only
specify the security controls, but also could stipulate specific implementation requirements for
the controls. For example, NIST SP 800-82 includes a security controls overlay for industrial
control systems; and NIST SP 800-161 includes a security controls overlay for supply chain.
8.6

IT System Security Evaluation

There are many IT system security evaluation standards with market acceptance that should be
relevant to IoT systems. Standards for security requirements for cryptographic modules (e.g.,
ISO/IEC 19790:2015) and security test requirements for cryptographic modules (e.g., ISO/IEC
24759:2014) are relevant for many types of IoT components. Other examples include: the threepart ISO/IEC 15408 for IT security evaluation; ISO/IEC TR 30104:2015 for guidance on
physical security attacks, mitigation techniques and security requirements; and UL 2900 for
testable cybersecurity criteria for network-connectable products and systems.
Market Impact
Although standards exist, practical application to IoT systems have not been consistently
demonstrated and is affecting implementation.
Possible Standards Gaps
Existing standards are not specific to IoT and should be reviewed to determine if they are
sufficient or require revision for IoT systems.
8.7

Network Security

There are many network security standards for various types of networks that are relevant to IoT
systems. Examples include: the 3GPP Long-Term Evolution (LTE) for high-speed wireless
communication for mobile phones; the Bluetooth wireless standard for exchanging data over
short distances from fixed and mobile devices, and building personal area networks; the IETF
51

NISTIR 8200

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

RFC 7252 for a generic web protocol for the special requirements of the constrained
environment of machine-to-machine (M2M) applications; IEC 62591:2016 for industrial
wireless sensor networks; the IEEE 1609 family of standards for Wireless Access in Vehicular
Environments (WAVE); IEEE 802.11-2016 for Wi-FiTM; the OMA Lightweight Machine to
Machine Technical Specification, a device management protocol designed for sensor networks
and the demands of a machine-to-machine (M2M) environment; and the ZigBee 3.0 specification
that enables IoT components from separate IoT systems/applications to communicate.
Market Impact
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

Many of these existing standards have widespread market acceptance with numerous commercial
implementations.
Possible Standards Gaps
Updates and/or new standards may be needed to deal with the IoT cybersecurity considerations
listed in Section 4.3. Additionally, many of these existing standards may require updates and/or
new standards to address IoT networks that have the potential for spontaneous connection (due to
the networking) without a system view. Such IoT systems cannot be planned or secured well
using traditional approaches to security since system compositional or emergent properties
would never be seen by a risk manager.
IEEE 802.15.7 is a physical layer specification for visible light communication. Standards from
the viewpoint of application service function development have yet to be developed.
8.8

Physical Security

IoT components may be in remote and unattended locations where physical access is almost
unrestricted. Due to their cost model, very low cost IoT components cannot be protected by
physically hardening the component or by adding anti-tampering features.
Where physical access can be controlled, there are sector specific and generic standards
available, such as the six-part ISO/IEC TS 22237 for data center facilities and infrastructures and
Security Industry Association (SIA) Open Supervised Device Protocol (OSDP) v2.1.7 for
interoperability among access control and security products.
Market Impact
Existing standards are being implemented.
Possible Standards Gaps
A specific standard or standard development project does not appear to exist for physical security
requirements and guidance for IoT components and IoT systems. This should be a candidate for
additional standards efforts.
8.9

Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM)

There are several approved and draft SACM standards. Most are specifically relevant to IoT
systems. Approved standards include: IEC TR 62443-2-3:2015 for requirements for asset owners
and industrial automation and control system (IACS) product suppliers that have established and
52

NISTIR 8200

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

are now maintaining an IACS patch management program; and the IETF RFC 7632 with use
cases for securely aggregating configuration and operational data and evaluating that data to
determine an organization's security posture. IETF Active Internet Drafts include: the ResourceOriented Lightweight Information Exchange (ROLIE) Definition of the ROLIE Software
Descriptor Extension; Concise Software Identifiers; Endpoint Compliance Profile; Software
Inventory Message and Attributes (SWIMA) for PA-TNC; and Security Automation and
Continuous Monitoring (SACM) Terminology.
Market Impact
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

The resource limitations of IoT devices (memory, processor, power) can make it difficult to
implement agent-based approaches to continuous monitoring. Device manufacturers will need to
consider price and performance as more advanced capabilities are developed. The IoT ecosystem
is heterogeneous and until standards are in place and broadly adopted, device manufacturers and
security vendors will need to make investments in developing device-specific agents and
interfaces for monitoring.
Possible Standards Gaps
Adoption of standard protocols, interfaces, and data models will help achieve the interoperability
needed to automate security operations.
8.10 Software Assurance

There are many approved software assurance standards. Many are specifically relevant to IoT
systems. Examples include: IEC 82304-1:2016 for the safety and security of health software
products; ISO/IEC 20243:2015 for secure engineering best practices, including secure
management of the products, components, and their supply chains; the multi-part ISO/IEC 27036
for the information security for supplier relationships; and the UL 2900 criteria to assess
software vulnerabilities and weaknesses, minimize exploitation, address known malware, review
security controls and increase security awareness.
Market Impact
Despite known impacts of insecure software, the pace of adoption is slow. This is because
detecting malware in software is technically challenging and could be time consuming and
expensive.
Possible Standards Gaps
The integration of best practices for software development into standards for IoT contributing
disciplines is slow.
Detecting malware in software is technically challenging. Developing best practices for avoiding
malware in software could be an area for new standards development.

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

8.11 Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM)

There are three approved SCRM standards. They are relevant to IoT systems or specific IoT
systems (i.e., medical IoT components). They are the multi-part ISO/IEC 27036; ISO/IEC
20243:2015; and UL 2900, which are also included above for software assurance.
Market Impact
The market has been slow to implement.
Possible Standards Gaps
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

The generic standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 27036) are not specific to IoT and they need to be reviewed
to determine if they are sufficient or require revision for IoT systems.
8.12 System Security Engineering

There are many approved or draft system security engineering standards. Some are relevant to
IoT systems or specific IoT systems (e.g., healthcare). Examples include: ISO/IEC/IEEE
15288:2015 for a set of systems engineering processes and associated terminology; the ISA/IEC
62443 series for Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) that includes security
management requirements.
The generic, multipart ISO/IEC 15026 for systems and software engineering assurance may be
relevant to IoT systems.
Market Impact
It is unclear if system security engineers apply systems engineering practices to IoT systems.
This would lead to additional implementation costs.
Possible Standards Gaps
It is unclear if the generic system engineering standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 15026) consider IoT
systems as part of the IT system.

Based upon the preceding information and analysis, Table 4 provides a snapshot of the present
status of cybersecurity standards development and their implementation by the marketplace.
“Standards Available – May Need Revisions” indicates that SDO-approved cybersecurity
standards are for the most part available while some additional standards may still be needed.
However, these standards should be reviewed and possibly revised to deal with existing and
emerging IoT cybersecurity considerations such as those listed in Section 4.3.

“Some Standards – May Need Revisions” indicates that some SDO-approved cybersecurity
standards are available. However, additional standards may be needed and existing standards
should be reviewed and possibly revised to deal with existing and emerging IoT cybersecurity
considerations such as those listed in Section 4.3.
“Being Developed” indicates that needed SDO-approved cybersecurity standards are still under
development to deal with existing and emerging IoT cybersecurity considerations such as those
listed in Section 4.3.
“Standards Needed” indicates that new cybersecurity standards development projects need to
be considered by various SDOs.
“Implemented – May Need Updates” indicates that two or more standards-based
implementations are available for most of these SDO-approved cybersecurity standards. As
standards are reviewed and possibly revised to deal with existing and emerging IoT
cybersecurity considerations such as those listed in Section 4.3, implementations may need to be
updated.
“Slow Uptake- May Need Updates” indicates market implementations are lagging for many
SDO-approved cybersecurity standards. As standards are reviewed and possibly revised to deal
with existing and emerging IoT cybersecurity considerations such as those listed in Section 4.3,
implementations may need to be updated.
“Not Implemented” indicates a lack of known commercial implementations. This may be
caused by cybersecurity standards still being under development or new standards projects will
be needed.
Where there are existing standards that are being implemented, it should be noted that these
standards typically require continuous maintenance and updating. This is based upon feedback
from testing and deployments of standards-based products, processes, and services, as well as
improvements in technology

STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY
STANDARDIZATION FOR IOT

Conclusions

The functional description of IoT (Section 4) in this report provides a starting point for assessing
and improving the current state of international cybersecurity standards development for IoT. It
may also serve as a basis for future understanding and communications among agencies about
IoT and cybersecurity-related challenges and solutions.

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

Several IoT applications have been reviewed in this report to better understand IoT cybersecurity
objectives, risks, and threats. From this review, it appears that many IoT systems, which have
been developed for diverse agency missions, share common cybersecurity threats. Specific IoT
applications may face additional classes of threats. Cybersecurity risk assessments need to be
based upon an IoT application’s priorities for confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
information.
With the continuing, rapid innovation of IT, the inventory of IoT-relevant cybersecurity
standards will remain dynamic. Annex D of this report lists international cybersecurity standards
that the IoT Task Group has identified to be IoT relevant. The listing is substantial but it is not
being represented as complete. It is also a one-time, static listing. The standards have been
organized by the 12 core areas of cybersecurity described in this report (Section 7). The
substantial number of standards for some of the core cybersecurity areas are the result of IT
innovation as well as competitive solutions for various technologies. Based upon the
information in Annex D, a high-level summary has been developed of IoT-relevant cybersecurity
standards including market impact, where known, and possible standards gaps (Section 8).
The identified possible standards gaps are:
 Cryptographic Techniques: applying blockchain technology should be explored for IoT
security mechanisms;
 Cyber Incident Management: best practices for remediation should be explored when
software patches are not feasible;
 Hardware Assurance: best practices for avoiding malware in firmware should be
explored;
 Identity and Access Management: existing standards should be reviewed to determine
if they are sufficient or require revision for IoT systems;
 Information Security Management Systems (ISMS): management system standards
based upon ISO/IEC 27002 for IoT applications based upon 27000 series should be
considered;
 IT System Security Evaluation: existing standards are not specific to IoT and should be
reviewed to determine if they are sufficient or require revision for IoT systems;
 Network Security: existing standards may require updates and/or new standards will be
needed to address IoT networks that have the potential for spontaneous connections (due
to the networking) without a system view;
 Physical Security: physical security requirements and guidance for IoT components and
IoT systems does not exist and new standards should be investigated;
 Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring: since the IoT ecosystem is
heterogeneous, IoT device manufacturers and security vendors may need to develop

device-specific agents and interfaces for monitoring until the standards are tailored for
the various IoT use cases and implemented in products;
Software Assurance: standards for avoiding vulnerabilities in software should be
investigated (e.g., malware; integration of best practices for software development into
standards for IoT contributing disciplines);
Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM): generic standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 27036) are
not specific to IoT and should be reviewed to determine if they are sufficient or require
revision for IoT systems; and
System Security Engineering: generic system security engineering standards (e.g.,
ISO/IEC 15026) should be reviewed for application to IoT systems.

Agencies should further review these possible standards gaps with respect to their respective
missions. For identified priorities, agencies should work with industry to initiate new standards
projects in SDOs to close such gaps.
Further, based upon agency missions and use of specific IoT systems and applications, agencies
should also review existing standards (e.g., Annex D) to ascertain if they need to be revised to
deal with existing and emerging IoT cybersecurity considerations such as those listed in Section
4.3.
Table 4 provides a summary of the Task Group’s views on the status of cybersecurity
standardization for the five IoT applications described in Sections 5 and 6.
The availability and use of international cybersecurity standards are major factors for ensuring
the secure and resilient operation of the expanding number of agency mission critical IoT
systems. In accordance with U.S. Government policy, agencies should participate in the
development of these standards in many SDOs and, based upon each agency’s mission, cite
appropriate standards in agency procurements.
Also, in accordance with federal policy, agencies should support the development of appropriate
conformity assessment schemes to the requirements in such standards. U.S. industry has a rich
history of developing conformity assessment (CA) programs to meet our society’s needs. In the
IT sector for example, the Wi-FiTM logo appearing on wireless network devices shows that the
product has been tested and certified by the Wi-FiTM Alliance, a non-profit member association,
whose goal is to ensure that any device carrying the logo connect seamlessly to any Wi-FiTM
network. Many consumers may not understand the technical details of Wi-FiTM, but they have
confidence that the logo ensures that the device will connect to their home networks.
The decision on the type, independence and technical rigor of conformity assessment for IoT
should be risk-based. The need for confidence in conformity must be balanced with the cost to
the public and private sectors, including their international operations and legal obligations.
Successful conformity assessment provides the needed level of confidence, is efficient, and has a
sustainable and scalable business model.

Annex A—Some IoT Definitions and Descriptions

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8200

Internet of Things (IoT) [6]
Systems underpin every facet of American society—from transportation to utilities to
communications—and are accessible and often controllable from around the world. More
devices are connected to networks, and those networks are connected to each other, a concept
known as IoT; however, there is no universal definition of IoT, just as there is no agreement in
the use of that name to describe this trend. Whether it is called IoT, the Industrial Internet, or
cyber-physical systems (CPS), the term describes a decentralized network of objects (or devices),
applications, and services that can sense, log, interpret, communicate, process, and act on a
variety of information or control devices in the physical environment. These devices range from
small sensors on consumer devices to sophisticated computers in industrial control systems
(ICS). Ultimately, the devices have some type of kinetic impact on the physical world, whether
directly or through a mechanical device to which they are connected.
Internet of Things (IoT) [28]
An infrastructure of interconnected objects, people, systems and information resources together
with intelligent services to allow them to process information of the physical and the virtual
world and react.
Internet of Things (IoT) [29]
It is important to understand what the Internet of Things is and what the difference is between
IoT ecosystem and an IoT system. A simple definition of an Internet of Things system is “a
system of entities (including cyber-physical devices, information resources, and people) that
exchange information and interact with the physical world by sensing, processing information,
and actuating.” An IoT ecosystem may be defined as “an infrastructure of networked objects
(cyber-physical devices, information resources, and people) that can be combined to create
systems that interact with the physical world.
Internet of Things (IoT) [2]
In this context, the term IoT refers to the connection of systems and devices with primarily
physical purposes (e.g., sensing, heating/cooling, lighting, motor actuation, transportation) to
information networks (including the Internet) via interoperable protocols, often built into
embedded systems.
Internet of Things (IoT) [30]
This green paper will continue to use the term Internet of Things as an umbrella term to
reference the technological development in which a greatly increasing number of devices are
connected to one another and/or to the Internet. This acknowledges the widespread use and
general popular acceptance of the term. The term itself is, as pointed out by some commenters, a
misnomer, as many of the devices included in the Internet of Things do not use Internet Protocol
or in any event may not connect directly to the Internet. At times, IoT term is more descriptive of
the system or network than an actual thing. IoT has become the commonly used term for the
technologies and related issues discussed here, and for the sake of simplicity it will be used
throughout this paper.

There is no formal, analytic, or even descriptive set of the building blocks that govern the
operation, trustworthiness, and lifecycle of IoT. A composability model and vocabulary that
defines principles common to most, if not all networks of things, is needed to address the
question: “what is the science, if any, underlying IoT?” This document offers an underlying and
foundational science to IoT based on a belief that IoT involves sensing, computing,
communication, and actuation.

Encryption: BLE uses AES-CCM cryptography. Like Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR),
the LE controller will perform the encryption function. This function generates 128-bit encrypted
data from a 128-bit key and 128-bit plaintext data using the AES-128-bit cypher defined in FIPS1971.
Signed Data: BLE supports the ability to send authenticated data over an unencrypted transport
between two devices with a trusted relationship. This is accomplished by signing the data with a
CSRK.

quantum-safe cryptography (QSC). Specifically, it examines some typical applications where
cryptographic primitives are deployed today and discusses some points for consideration by
developers, highlighting features that may need change to accommodate quantum-safe

2. Initiation: to initiate authentication the authenticator will periodically transmit EAPRequest Identity frames to a special Layer 2 address on the local network segment.
3. Negotiation: The authentication server sends a reply to the authenticator, containing an
EAP Request specifying the EAP Method. The authenticator encapsulates the EAP
Request in an Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN (EAPOL) frame and transmits
it to the supplicant. At this point the supplicant can start using the requested EAP Method,
or do an NAK ("Negative Acknowledgement") and respond with the EAP Methods it is
willing to perform.
4. Authentication: If the authentication server and supplicant agree on an EAP Method, EAP
Requests and Responses are sent between the supplicant and the authentication server
(translated by the authenticator) until the authentication server responds with either an
EAP-Success message (encapsulated in a RADIUS Access-Accept packet), or an EAPFailure message (encapsulated in a RADIUS Access-Reject packet). If authentication is
successful, the authenticator sets the port to the "authorized" state and normal traffic is
allowed, if it is unsuccessful the port remains in the "unauthorized" state. When the
supplicant logs off, it sends an EAPOL-logoff message to the authenticator, the
authenticator then sets the port to the "unauthorized" state, once again blocking all nonEAP traffic.

Description

1. Balanced password-authenticated key agreement – two parties share a common password
and they want to prove to each other that they know the password, and only then engage
in secure communications, without revealing the password to others.
2. Augmented password-authenticated key agreement methods – similar to the first except
that one of the parties, the Server, has password verification data derived using a one-way
function of the password.
3. Password- authenticated key retrieval – addresses the scenario where one desires to
further decrease the sensitivity of stored password-derived data.
All these methods require one or more parties to use specific password-related data to make the
method succeed.
Primitives: The following types of primitives are defined in this standard:
• Random element derivation primitives (REDP), components of password-authenticated
key agreement schemes (PKAS) and password-authenticated key retrieval schemes
(PKRS).
• Password-entangled public-key generation primitives (PEPKGP); components of PKASs

DECT ULE communications are secured at the link layer (DLC) by encryption and per-message

AES128.
The DECT ULE (Digital Enhances Cordless Telecommunications Ultra Low Energy) pairing

Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0
What is TPM 2.0?
An International standard (also published as ISO/IEC 11889:2015) that enables trust in
computing platforms in general by receiving commands

TPM
September 2016
or later

TCG

The TPM 2.0 provides support for a wide array of cryptographic operations including hashing,
symmetric and asymmetric encryption, key generation, digital signatures, random number
generation, protected storage and protected capabilities. The TPM architecture is cryptographic
agile with support for numerous algorithms and curves with an extensible model to add more
algorithms or curves as needed. The TPM 2.0 standard uses a library model so simpler profiles
for a particular purpose can be defined using a subset of the available algorithms and capabilities
to address platform specific requirements or constraints like Mobile, Automotive or IoT.
The TPM 2.0 can create Endorsement Keys that serve as a statically unique TPM identity or an
identity for an IoT component that a TPM is bound to. TPM manufacturers may also issue
Endorsement Key certificates to provide confidence to third parties that interaction with a TPM is
based on an implementation provided by the manufacturer issuing the certificate. TPM generated
keys can be used for device authentication and cryptographically associated with Endorsement
Keys in a TPM.
TPM 2.0 supports anonymous remote attestation to help remote entities validate IoT component
software measurements stored in a TPM during the boot process or based on the dynamic launch
of a measured component. Remote attestation and its local equivalent called sealing provide
evidence of IoT component integrity for both code and configuration.

Each Thread node receives the Master Key when joining and assigns it to the thrMasterKey

The use of Hashed Message Authentication Mode with the SHA-256 algorithm (HMACSHA256) as the keyed hash function produces an output of 32 bytes. Therefore, this is sufficient

The goal of MUD is to provide a means for end devices to signal to the network what sort of access
and network functionality they require to properly function. The initial focus is on access control.
The MUD supporting network controller enforces security policies derived from a policy file
originally provided by the IoT device manufacturer. Moreover, the MUD controller can enforce
security policies for classes of devices. For example, the MUD controller can ensure that an IP
camera communicates with its monitoring station server only. If physical compromise of the IP
camera attempts to divert video streaming to an adversary server, the MUD controller will block and
flag these attempts, assuming correct implementation of the MUD file and network administration.

The Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC) has been re-launched in early 2016 as the Open
Connectivity Foundation (OCF)
OMA’s LightweightM2M is a device management protocol designed for sensor networks and the
demands of a machine-to-machine (M2M) environment.
Access Control: In the particular case where a single LwM2M Server Account exists in the
LwM2M Client, the Server must have full access right on all the Objects and Object Instances in the
LwM2M Client.

Access Control Object: In the presence of several LwM2M Servers, there is a need to determine if a
certain LwM2M Server is authorized to instantiate a supported Object in the LwM2M Client. This
kind of authorization can only be managed during a Bootstrap Phase.
Furthermore, the LwM2M Client needs to determine – per Object Instance – who the “Access
Control Owner” of the Object Instance is
DTLS-based Security: For authentication of communicating LwM2M entities, the LwM2M protocol
required that all communication between LwM2M Clients and LwM2M Servers as well as LwM2M
Clients and LwM2M Bootstrap-Servers are authenticated using mutual authentication.

Hashes can be used to verify the integrity of code modules by taking the hash of the good known

The TPM 2.0 provides support for a wide array of cryptographic operations including hashing,
symmetric and asymmetric encryption, key generation, digital signatures, random number
generation, protected storage and protected capabilities. The TPM architecture is cryptographic
agile with support for numerous algorithms and curves with an extensible model to add more
algorithms or curves as needed. The TPM 2.0 standard uses a library model so simpler profiles for a
particular purpose can be defined using a subset of the available algorithms and capabilities to
address platform specific requirements or constraints like Mobile, Automotive or IoT.
The TPM 2.0 can create Endorsement Keys that serve as a statically unique TPM identity or an
identity for an IoT component that a TPM is bound to. TPM manufacturers may also issue
Endorsement Key certificates to provide confidence to third parties that interaction with a TPM is
based on an implementation provided by the manufacturer issuing the certificate. TPM generated
keys can be used for device authentication and cryptographically associated with Endorsement Keys
in a TPM.O
TPM 2.0 supports anonymous remote attestation to help remote entities validate IoT component

standardized framework, the threats applicable to medical device products and components.
The DTSec assurance-through-evaluation program helps developers identify vulnerabilities by
augmenting the developer secure development lifecycle with independent vulnerability
assessment by qualified cybersecurity test labs.
Assessment of the impact of threats and vulnerabilities on the device functionality and end
user/patients:
DTSec helps to assess the impact of threats and vulnerabilities on device functionality and end
users/patients by requiring developers to consider relevant threats and how they might impact
safe clinical use.
DTSec also helps assess the impact of vulnerabilities discovered during the security evaluation
program
DTSec also helps stakeholders balance the need for security with essential clinical performance.
Assessment of the likelihood of a threat and of a vulnerability being exploited:
DTSec helps to assess the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. As part of the
vulnerability assessment requirement included in the Protection Profiles and Security Targets,
the security evaluator will attempt to understand not only whether a vulnerability is exploitable
but also what level of attack potential is required to exploit.

In a 6LoWPAN stack, sensitive information will normally be protected by transport- or
application-layer (or even IP-layer) security, which are all above the adaptation layer, leaving
no sensitive information to compress at the GHC level. However, a 6LoWPAN deployment that
entirely depends on Media Access Control (MAC) layer security may be vulnerable to attacks
that exploit redundancy information disclosed by compression to recover information about
secret values. This attack is fully mitigated by not exposing secret values to the adaptation layer
or by not using GHC in deployments where this is done.

Security Considerations: The primary additional security considerations raised by DTLS is that of
denial of service. DTLS includes a cookie exchange designed to protect against denial of service.
However, implementation which do not use this cookie exchange are still vulnerable to DoS. In
particular, DTLS servers which do not use this cookie exchange may be used as attack amplifiers
even if they themselves are not experiencing DoS. Therefore, DTLS servers should use the cookie
exchange unless there is good reason to believe that amplification is not a threat in their
environment. Clients must be prepared to do a cookie exchange with every handshake.
Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
CoAP is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained
networks in the Internet of Things.
The protocol is designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and
building automation.
Parsing the Protocol and Processing URIs: CoAP attempts to narrow the opportunities for
introducing network-facing application vulnerabilities by: reducing parser complexity, giving the
entire range of encodable values a meaning where possible, and by aggressively reducing

Description

complexity that is often cause by unnecessary choice between multiple representations that mean
the same thing.
Risk of Amplification: An attacker might use CoAP nodes to turn a small attack packet into a
larger attack packet, an approach known as amplification. There is therefore a danger that CoAP
nodes could become implicated in denial-of-service attacks by using the amplifying properties of
the protocol. As a mitigating factor, many constrained networks will only be able to generate a
small amount of traffic, which may make CoAP nodes less attractive for this attack. Therefore,
large amplification factors should not be provided in the response if the request is not
authenticated.
IP Address Spoofing Attacks: Due to the lack of handshake in UDP, a rogue endpoint that is free to
read and write messages carried by the constrained network may easily attack a single endpoint, a
group of endpoints, as well as a whole network. Response spoofing by off-path attackers can be
detected and mitigated even without transport later security by choosing a nontrivial, randomized
token in the request.
Page 80, Section 11
Note: Like Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), CoAP does not provide these services
but rather recommends another standard D-TLS.
Securing CoAP: The device will be in one of the four security modes:
NoSec: There is no protocol-level security (DTLS is disabled)
PreSharedKey: DTLS is enabled, there is a list of pre-shared keys, and each key includes a list of
which nodes it can be used to communicate with.

consumer devices. The scope of this specification supports the objectives of the integration, and
includes the dependability case for argumentation, as well as the dependability
development process to be newly defined. The focus is to include the dependability
argumentation particularly for consumer devices. In the future, it may be desirable to introduce
additional argumentation methodology for other systems such as avionics or railways.
However, they are outside of the scope for the current effort as the authors are not experts in
other systems rather than consumer devices.

This TIR provides guidance for addressing information security within the risk management framework
defined by ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971.
This guidance is intended to assist manufacturers and other users of the standard in the following:
• Identifying threats, vulnerabilities, and assets associated with medical devices
• Estimating and evaluating associated security risks
• Controlling security risks
• Monitoring effectiveness of the risk controls
Specification for security management systems for the supply chain
Specifies the requirements for a security management system, including those aspects critical to security
assurance of the supply chain. Security management is linked to many other aspects of business
management. Aspects include all activities controlled or influenced by organizations that affect supply
chain security. These other aspects should be considered directly, where and when they have an impact on
security management, including transporting these goods along the supply chain.

not only can notifications messages be much larger than the request message, but the nature of the

protocol can cause a significant number of notifications to be generated. Without client authentication,
a server therefore MUST strictly limit the number of notifications that it sends between receiving
acknowledgements that confirm the actual interest of the client in the data; i.e., any notifications sent
in non-confirmable messages MUST be interspersed with confirmable messages. Note that an attacker
may still spoof the acknowledgements if the confirmable messages are sufficiently predictable.
